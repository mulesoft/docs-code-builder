Anypoint Code Builder bundles a version 4 instance of Mule runtime engine (Mule) to run your integrations and implementations.  

Do not change the default locations of Mule unless you receive an error that Mule is not found or installed. If such errors occur, the following properties enable you to change the path to Mule:

* *Mule Runtimes Directory*: The default location of the Mule installation.
+
Default value: `/Users/<user-name>/muleRuntimes/`
* *Mule Home*: The full path that points to the root files of the Mule instance.
+
Default value: `/Users/<user-name>/muleRuntimes/<mule-runtime-installation>`


== Mule Runtime Is Not Installed

The error `Mule Runtime Is Not Installed, You Must Configure a Mule Runtime to Enable This Feature` occurs if *Mule Home* and *Mule Runtimes Directory* are misconfigured or empty and a feature requires a running Mule instance. For example, auto-completion and debugging features require Mule to run. 

To troubleshoot this issue, use the following procedure: 

. Locate the *Mule > Runtime: Mule Home* and *Mule > Runtime: Mule Runtimes Directory* properties:

. Provide the full path to the folder that contains Mule runtime. This field must not be empty.

== No Mule Runtime Found

The warning `No Mule runtime found. To perform this action, you must have Mule runtime configured.`
occurs if Mule is not configured properly when you open Anypoint Code Builder. 
The *Mule Home* or *Mule Runtimes Directory* fields are misconfigured or empty. 

To troubleshoot this issue, use the following procedure:

. Navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view, and select the *Open ACB Settings* icon.

. Locate the *Mule > Runtime: Mule Home* and *Mule > Runtime: Mule Runtimes Directory* properties:
+

. Provide the full path to the folder that contains Mule runtime. This field must not be empty. 

== Please Download and Install a JDK to Compile Your Project

This request is _not_ from MuleSoft or Anypoint Code Builder:

Instead of using this feature, you can use the command *Download Mule Runtime and Java Versions*. See also, xref:anypoint-code-builder::int-versions.adoc[].
