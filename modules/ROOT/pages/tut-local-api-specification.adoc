= Iteratively Design and Implement an API Specification

Scaffold an API specification into an implementation project within your IDE, and sync changes to the specification with the interface without first publishing to Anypoint Exchange. For example, after adding a new endpoint to your API specification, you can re-scaffold the change into the interface to add a flow for that endpoint to the interface's configuration XML file.

The interface XML is automatically created in a Mule project during the scaffolding process. You define an API in a specification file within an API Design project.

Iterative API design and implementation within the IDE takes place in a _multi-root workspace_ in VS Code. To map project folders for your API specification and implementation projects into a multi-root workspace, VS Code uses a file with the extension `.code-workspace`. For your projects to work properly, this file _must not reside within_ either project folder. In addition, Anypoint Code Builder permits only one pair of iterative design and implementation project folders per multi-root workspace. The procedures for creating the specification and implementation projects are designed to meet these requirements. For information in the VS Code documentation, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[Multi-root Workspaces^].

NOTE: The procedures are currently written for the desktop IDE only.

[[prereqs]]
== Before You Begin

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. See xref:start-acb.adoc[] for more information.

[[create]]
== Create an API Specification

. In the desktop IDE, open a new window in VS Code by pressing Cmd+Shift+n (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+n (Windows).
+
This step helps prevent the possibility of creating an API specification in a multi-root workspace that already contains iterative design and implementation projects and ensures that the command required in the next procedure, <<scaffold>>, is available.
. In the activity bar of the desktop IDE, click the image:icon-ms-logo.png["",20,20] (*Anypoint Code Builder*) icon to open Anypoint Code Builder.
. Start an API specification by clicking the quick action *Design an API*. 
+
Alternatively, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Design an API
----
. If prompted, sign in to Anypoint Platform, and follow all the prompts to reopen the IDE.
. Complete the *API Specification* form:
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"]
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | *Retrieve Users API* +
Alternatively, provide a similar name of your choice. The name must be unique. The name of the project and specification file is based on the name you provide.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create (see xref:start-add-folders.adoc[]).
| *API Type* | *REST API* +
Anypoint Code Builder supports REST and AsyncAPI API types.
| *API Specification Language* | *RAML 1.0* +
Anypoint Code Builder supports OAS and RAML.
|===

. Click *Create Project*.
+
This process creates a project that contains your API specification within your workspace.
. Open your API specification file, `retrieve-users-api.raml`. 
. To track the progress of internal processing, open the *Output* panel to the *Mule DX Server*.

              } }]

. Proceed to <<scaffold>>.

[[scaffold]]
== Scaffold the Local API Specification into an Interface

Scaffold your local API specification into a local implementation project. The scaffolding process creates a configuration XML for your implementation. 

Local projects reside in the Anypoint Code Builder IDE, whether the projects are in your desktop IDE or in the cloud IDE associated with your user account in Anypoint Platform. 

To scaffold your local API specification:

. With `retrieve-users-api.raml` open in your IDE, prepare to scaffold the specification into a Mule project:
+
.. Click the image:icon-implement-api.png["",15,15] (*Implement this local API*) icon in the activity bar:
+
[[icon-implement-this-api]]
image::tut-local-spec-implement.png["UI with the X-shaped icon for the command Implement this Local API"]
+
Alternatively, open the Command Palette by pressing Cmd+Shift+p (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement this Local API
----
+
Do not select the command `MuleSoft: Implement an API Specification`, which is for implementing a specification that is published on Anypoint Exchange and not for implementing a local API specification. 

.. Click *OK* when the UI displays the message *We'll create a workspace to keep your API specification and Mule project in sync.*
+
IMPORTANT: At the prompt to save a file with the extension `.code-workspace` for a multi-root workspace, do not save this file within your API specification project folder. Proceed to the next step, instead.
.. Navigate up to the parent folder you created for your workspace, and save the `.code-workspace` file.
.. Make sure that your *Mule DX Server* output is available for tracking the progress of internal processes in the *Output* panel.
+
The UI displays a message: *Implementing local API implementation, please wait.* 
+
As you monitor output, wait for the field with placeholder text `_Mule project name_` to appear in the UI, for example:
+
image::tut-api-create-project.png["Provide name of scaffolded implementation project"]
. Start the scaffolding process by entering a name for your Mule implementation project, such as `retrieve-users-implementation`:
+
image::tut-api-create-project-retrieve-users.png["Provide name of scaffolded implementation project"]
. When prompted, click  *Select target folder*. 
+
The target folder is the project folder where you created your API specification.
+
The UI provides updates while the scaffolding process takes place:

* *Executing scaffolding operation, please wait*
* *Scaffolding process ended. You can now start iterating over your local API and implementation project*
. From your multi-root workspace in the Explorer, the IDE opens the scaffolded specification in your new Mule project. 
+
The configuration XML file for the implementation (`retrieve-users-implementation.xml`) is located in an implementation project directory similar to this one:
+
[source,implementation project directory]
----
retrieve-users-implementation/src/main/mule/retrieve-users-implementation.xml
----
* The canvas UI for this Mule project contains a Router component and several error handlers. APIkit automatically creates these components during the scaffolding process.
* In the implementation XML, the flow `<flow name="get:\users:retrieve-users-api-config">` contains an `<ee:transform/>` element with your example:

The status bar provides progress-related messages before the IDE updates your Mule project POM file to point to `v1.0.0` of your API specification: 

** *Publishing API Specification to Exchange* 
** _Project_ *has been successfully published to Exchange*

The specification is now available on https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?show=org&sort=last[Anypoint Exchange^] for team members in your business group to scaffold into their projects and implement. See <<scaffold-from-exchange>>.

== Scaffold the API Specification from Exchange

Team members in your business group can import your API specification from Exchange:

. Open a new VS Code instance. 
. Import version 1.0.0 of your API from Design Center:

== Display the Command MuleSoft: Implement this Local API

If `MuleSoft: Implement this Local API Command` does not appear in the command palette from your open API specification project, potential causes are: 

* Another project in your multi-root workspace is implementing a local API specification. 
* The API specification is already has a snapshot version. 
+
The `exchange.json` file in the specification project should not have the `-SNAPSHOT` postfix.

To remove your project from a multi-root workspace:

. In the Explorer, right-click your new API specification folder, select *Remove project from workspace*.
. Open a new VS Code window by pressing Ctrl+Shift+n (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+n (Windows).
. In the new window, navigate to the API specification, and open the specification file:

== Close a Multi-Root Workspace

Close a multi-root workspace with the command `Workspaces: Close Workspace`. 

After closing, you can reopen a synchronized project from the workspace that you create when implementing the API.

== Open a Multi-Root Workspace

Open a multi-root workspace from the `.code-workspace` file, such as `Retrieve Users API.code-workspace`, for the projects in the workspace. 

. Open VS Code.
// Pointer to Command Palette
