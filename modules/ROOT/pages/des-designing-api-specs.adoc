= Designing API Specs and Fragments
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide
// :page-aliases: help-overview-design.adoc

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 

Use Anypoint Code Builder to create, design, test, and publish new API specifications to Exchange.

The process for designing API specifications is:

. xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[Create or import and test your API specification]
. xref:des-create-api-fragments.adoc[Optionally, create and add fragments to your specification].
. xref:des-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[Publish your API specifications to Exchange].

For source management options, see xref:start-scm.adoc#anypoint-scm[SCM for API Design Projects].

[[supported-spec-languages]]
== Supported OAS and RAML Versions for API Specs

Supported OAS and RAML versions are:

* OAS 2.0 (JSON)
* OAS 2.0 (YAML)
* OAS 3.0 (JSON)
* OAS 3.0 (YAML)
* RAML 1.0
* RAML 0.8

[[supported-fragment-languages]]
== Supported Specification Languages for API Fragments

Create, include, or reference API fragments within your API specification. 

Supported API specification languages and syntaxes for API fragments are:

* OAS 3.0
** YAML
** JSON
* RAML 1.0

See the RAML 1.0 specification for descriptions of these types:

** Trait
** Resource
** Library
** Data Type
** User Documentation
** Example
--
* JSON Schema

[[resource-reqs]]
== Minimum Resource Requirements for the Desktop IDE

When parsing an API specification, the desktop IDE depends on your computer's resources. To avoid issues, ensure that your computer has the following minimum resources available:

[[best-practices]]
== Best Practices

To avoid common issues, follow these guidelines:

include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-api-design.adoc[tag="apid-best-practices"]

This best practice applies to the cloud IDE only. 

* Before designing an OAS or RAML API specification, review <<apid-best-practices-oas>> or <<apid-best-practices-raml>>

[[anypoint-scm]]
== Source Control for API Design Projects

// Shared intro to SCM
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="scm-intro-best-practice"]
Source control options for API design projects depend on how and when you created the project: 

* As of the February 2024 release, design projects that you create from scratch in Anypoint Code Builder with *Design an API* (see xref:anypoint-code-builder::des-create-api-specs.adoc#design-new-api-spec[Create a New API Specification Project]) or with the command `MuleSoft: Design an API` no longer spawn a corresponding design project in Design Center or use the Anypoint SCM to store and sync changes.  

* {empty} 
+

+
If you prefer to use your own remote repository, GitHub is one option. To store your API project in a repository on GitHub, without synchronizing with the project in Design Center, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-scm.adoc#add-extra-repo[publish your project files to another repository].
