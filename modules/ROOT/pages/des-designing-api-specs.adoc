= Designing API Specs and Fragments
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide
// :page-aliases: help-overview-design.adoc

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 

Use Anypoint Code Builder to create, design, test, and publish new API specifications to Exchange.

The process for designing API specifications is:

. xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[Create or import and test your API specification]
. xref:des-create-api-fragments.adoc[Optionally, create and add fragments to your specification].
. xref:des-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[Publish your API specifications to Exchange].

For source management options, see xref:start-scm.adoc#anypoint-scm[SCM for API Design Projects].

== Source Control for API Design Projects

// Shared intro to SCM
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="scm-intro-best-practice"]
Source control options for API design projects depend on how and when you created the project: 

* As of the February 2024 release, design projects that you create from scratch in Anypoint Code Builder with *Design an API* (see xref:anypoint-code-builder::des-create-api-specs.adoc#design-new-api-spec[Create a New API Specification Project]) or with the command `MuleSoft: Design an API` no longer spawn a corresponding design project in Design Center or use the Anypoint SCM to store and sync changes.  

* {empty} 
+
include::partial$acb-api-design.adoc[tags="api-dc-scm-scope"] 
+
If you prefer to use your own remote repository, GitHub is one option. To store your API project in a repository on GitHub, without synchronizing with the project in Design Center, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-scm.adoc#add-extra-repo[publish your project files to another repository].
