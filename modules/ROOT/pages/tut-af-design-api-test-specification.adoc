Use the Mocking Service in the API Console to check the GET request and response that you configured for American Flights API in xref:tut-af-design-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[]. 

== Before You Begin

If you haven't started the American Flight API specification, complete these procedures before attempting to test:

. xref:tut-af-design-am-flights-api.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[]

== Test Your API Specification

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the RAML file for your American Flights API specification (`american-flights-api.raml`).
. Click the *API Console* icon in the editor toolbar:
+
image::api-console-button.png["API Console icon highlighted in the editor toolbar"]
. In API Console, select the `get` method for the `flights/` resource:
+
image::select-get-method.png["get method for the flights/ resource highlighted in the API Console"]
. Click *Try It*:
+
image::select-try-it-button.png["Try it button highlighted in the API Console"]
. Select the *destination* text box inside *Query Parameters* and verify that the three values you defined in your API specification appear:
+
image::select-query-params.png["Values highlighted in the API Console"]
. Click *Send*.
. Verify that the API Console returns the response you defined with the imported fragment (`AmericanFlightsExample.raml`):
+
image::api-console-reponse.png["A 200 OK response highlighted in the API Console"]
+
The logic for selecting specific destinations is not yet implemented. 
+
Optionally, review your configured response examples when querying your mocked API endpoints.
//TODO: Consider adding something like this (and VERIFY FILE NAME des-sync-scm):
//In addition, synchronizing your API project with a source control management (SCM) system is a best practice. To understand source control options, see xref:des-sync-scm.adoc[]. It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to address SCM setup, which is recommended for projects intended for production releases.
