. *Activity Bar*: Use VS Code Activity Bar items as you work on your projects. Mouse over the items to find their names:

+
In addition to Anypoint Code Builder (MuleSoft icon), commonly used items in the Activity Bar include:
+
* *Explorer*: Open project files and folders.
* *Source Control*: Store your project files.
* *Run and Debug*: Run and debug integrations and implementations.
* *Extensions*: Open for installations and updates in the desktop IDE.

. *Anypoint Code Builder* (MuleSoft icon): Open the *Anypoint Code Builder* panel to start a project. Follow the tutorials to get started with API specification design, implementation, and integration development in Anypoint Code Builder.
. *Quick Actions*: Start an API specification, implementation, or integration project.
. *Settings*: Set Anypoint Code Builder configurations, including the xref:index.adoc#us-eu-clouds[US or EU cloud] for your IDE. Select the cloud where your Anypoint Platform user account resides.

== Compare Project UIs in the IDE 

The UIs of the web and desktop IDEs share the same structure. 

Integration and implementation projects are Mule applications with similar UIs:

. *Explorer*: Open a workspace for your project.
. *Editors*: Develop your project in the UI canvas and configuration XML files. Configuration XML files support <<use-autocomplete, auto-completion>>. 
. *Status Bar*: Check for your user name to learn if you are logged in to Anypoint Platform. 
. *Output Panel*: As your projects run in Anypoint Code Builder, view output and logs from *Mule DX Server*. Open the built-in command terminal. View problems and ports.

See xref:int-developing-integrations.adoc[] and xref:imp-implementing-api-specs.adoc[] for more detail.

API design projects include a service for mocking endpoints in the API Console:

. *Editor*: Configure API specification project files. This editor supports <<use-autocomplete, auto-completion>>. 
. *API Console*: Test endpoints on your examples.

== Use IntelliSense to Auto-Complete in the Editors

Anypoint Code Builder uses IntelliSense, a built-in code-completion feature of VS Code, 
to provide auto-completion in Editor views.

. In the Editor view, press Ctrl+Space to display available options.
. Enter a search term to narrow the results.
For example:
+
image::des-autocomplete.png[Auto-complete options for `get`]
+
IntelliSense shows different options, depending on the context.
For example:
+
image::des-autocomplete-context.png[Auto-complete options for `responses`]
. Use the arrow keys to navigate the list.
. Press Enter or Tab to insert the selected element.
+
Auto-complete adds the element to the code and places the cursor for you to add values.

For more information, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense[IntelliSense^] in the VS Code documentation.

== Change the Look and Feel of the IDE

Select a theme to change the look and feel of the desktop or cloud IDE.

. Select the *Manage* (gear) icon from the activity bar.
. Select *Themes* > *Color Themes*, and select a theme. For example, *Dark Modern*:
