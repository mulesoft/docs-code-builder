. *Activity Bar*: Use VS Code Activity Bar items as you work on your projects. Mouse over the items to find their names:
+
image:acb-activity-bar-buttons.png["Activity Bar buttons"]  
+
In addition to Anypoint Code Builder (MuleSoft icon), commonly used items in the Activity Bar include:
+
* *Explorer*: Open project files and folders.
* *Source Control*: Store your project files.
* *Run and Debug*: Run and debug integrations and implementations.
* *Extensions*: Open for installations and updates in the desktop IDE.
+
You can change the order of the items in your activity bar. 

. *Anypoint Code Builder* (MuleSoft icon): Open the *Anypoint Code Builder* panel to start a project. Follow the tutorials to get started with API specification design, implementation, and integration development in Anypoint Code Builder.
. *Quick Actions*: Start an API specification, implementation, or integration project.
. *Settings*: Set Anypoint Code Builder configurations, including the xref:index.adoc#us-eu-clouds[US or EU cloud] for your IDE. Select the cloud where your Anypoint Platform user account resides.

== Compare Project UIs in the IDE 

The UIs of the web and desktop IDEs share the same structure. 

Integration and implementation projects are Mule applications with similar UIs:

[calloutlist]
. *Explorer*: Open a workspace for your project.
. *Editors*: Develop your project in the canvas UI and configuration XML files. Configuration XML files support <<use-autocomplete, auto-completion>>. 
. *Status Bar*: Check for your user name to learn if you are logged in to Anypoint Platform. 
. *Output Panel*: As your projects run in Anypoint Code Builder, view output and logs from *Mule DX Server*. Open the built-in command terminal. View problems and ports.
+
See xref:int-developing-integrations.adoc[] and xref:imp-implementing-apis.adoc[] for more detail.

API design projects include a service for mocking endpoints in the API Console:

. *Editor*: Configure API specification project files. This editor supports <<use-autocomplete, auto-completion>>. 
. *API Console*: Test endpoints on your examples.
+
See xref:des-designing-api-specs.adoc[] for more detail.

== Use Auto-Complete in the Editors

The IDE supports auto-completion through the Anypoint Code Builder extensions and through IntelliSense, a built-in code-completion feature of VS Code, to provide auto-completion in Editor views. 

. Open auto-completion options from the Editor view using one of the following options:

* Using IntelliSense: Press Ctrl+Space to display a list of available option, and enter a search term to narrow the results, for example:
+
image::des-autocomplete.png[Auto-complete options for `get`]
+
IntelliSense shows different options, depending on the context, for example:
+
image::des-autocomplete-context.png[Auto-complete options for `responses`]

* Using the extensions: Start typing in the editor to display a list of available options. Typing narrows the list of suggested options.
+
For API design, auto-completion must be enabled (the default setting). You can disable or enable auto-completion:
+
.Show me how
[%collapsible]
====
[loweralpha]
include::partial$acb-api-design.adoc[tags="apid-extension-props"]
====

. Use the arrow keys to navigate the list.
. Press Enter or Tab to insert the selected element.
+
Auto-complete adds the element to the code and places the cursor for you to add values.

For more information, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense[IntelliSense^] in the VS Code documentation.

== Change the Look and Feel of the IDE

Select a theme to change the look and feel of the desktop or cloud IDE.

. Select the *Manage* (gear) icon from the activity bar.
. Select *Themes* > *Color Themes*, and select a theme, for example, *Dark Modern*:
