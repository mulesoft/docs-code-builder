To process your data with business logic, create an integration with connectors and other components in a Mule application.

A typical workflow includes one or more of the following tasks:

. Create or import an integration project:

* <<create-integration-project, Create an integration project>> 
+
Create the integration from scratch, or start from a project template or integration example that you import from Anypoint Exchange. For information about templates and examples in Exchange, see xref:exchange::asset-types.adoc[].
* xref:int-import-mule-project.adoc[Import a project].
. xref:int-configure-components.adoc[Add components to your project].

You can create multiple configuration XML files in your project. See <<create-new-config>>.

== Create an Integration Project

To create an integration project:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Develop an Integration*:
+
image::develop-integration-option-mat.png["Develop an Integration link highlighted in the Getting started section"]
. Provide a project name and location to the *Develop an Integration* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the title and name of the integration project file.
For example, if the project name is "OAS Integration," the project file name is `oas-integration`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create. Click *Browse* to select a different directory for the integration.

See xref:start-add-folders.adoc[].

. Create a project from scratch, or start with an asset from Anypoint Exchange.

[tabs]
====
*Start with an Empty Project*::
+

Click *Empty Project* to start an integration project from scratch, without any preconfigured components.

image::int-create-integration-scratch.png["Create integration project from scratch.", width=70%] 
--
*Start with a Project Template or Example*::
+
--
To import an existing integration template or example from Anypoint Exchange:

.. Click *Template or Example Project* to import an existing integration template or example from Anypoint Exchange. 
+
image::int-create-integration.png["Create integration project from an Exchange asset."]
.. If you intend to import a private asset associated with your business organization, xref:start-acb.adoc#login-ide[log in to Anypoint Platform from the IDE] to list the template or example in the search results.
+
Searches for public assets do not require login.
.. From the IDE, search for a template or for an example. 
+
Partial searches are accepted.
.. Mouse over the asset that you want to add.
.. Click *Add Asset*. 
--
====
. Select a *Mule runtime* and *Java* version. 
+
//Info about downloads:
include::partial$acb-runtime-java.adoc[tags="runtime-java-download"]
. Click *Create Project*.
+
//Info about download notifications and location:
include::partial$acb-runtime-java.adoc[tags="runtime-java-notification"]

When you create an integration project from scratch or if your project from Exchange does not contain a flow structure (Flow, Subflow, or Error handling component), the canvas UI provides the option to create one. Otherwise, the canvas UI generates a graphical representation of the imported asset's components that you can use to start your configuration.

[[create-new-config]]
== Create an Additional Configuration XML File

Anypoint Code Builder creates the initial Mule configuration XML file in `src/main/mule` within the Mule project.

You can create additional configuration files, for example, for an implementation file for a scaffolded interface or for global configurations that you can reference from an XML file. 

To create a new configuration XML file:

. In the Explorer view, right-click the *mule* folder (`src/main/mule`) and select *New Mule Configuration File...*.
. In the *New Mule Configuration File...* field that opens, provide a name for the new file without an extension.
+
image::int-add-config-xml.png["Provide name of Mule configuration XML file"]
+
The name must be unique within the project. Permitted special characters are `_` (underscore), `-` (hyphen), `.`, `@`, `(`, and `)`.
+
The process automatically appends an `xml` extension to the file name and opens the new configuration XML file and its canvas UI within the IDE. The new configuration XML file contains the `<mule/>` element with default namespaces:
+
[source,xml]
--
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core" 
      xmlns:doc="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd">
  
</mule>
--
+
The file's canvas UI provides the same options for building your project file that appear when you create an integration project. For an example and to get started with your configuration, see <<add-components, Add a Component to Your Project>>.
