Import a project JAR file or folder into a workspace in your IDE.
A project directory contains a Mule application for an integration or implementation. 

If you encounter an import issue, check for workarounds in xref:acb-release-notes.adoc#import-issues[Known Issues] in the Anypoint Code Builder Release Notes or in xref:troubleshooting.adoc[].

To _export_ a JAR file that packages a project with resources from your application, see xref:int-export-mule-project.adoc[].


== Before You Begin

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* Close any open project in your IDE.

IMPORTANT: Never open or unpack a project folder within another project folder.

//H2: DESKTOP
[[import-desktop]]
== Import and Open a Project in the Desktop IDE

Use the desktop IDE to upload a project directory or shareable JAR file into a project workspace. 

* <<desktop-project-package>>
* <<desktop-project-folder>>
* <<both-open-project-folder>>


[[desktop-project-package]]
=== Import a Shareable Project JAR File into the Desktop IDE

Import a shareable JAR file for a snapshot of a Mule project into the desktop IDE.

To create a shareable JAR file, see xref:int-export-mule-project.adoc#shareable[Export to a Shareable JAR File].
The contents are lightweight because they don't include dependencies.
The IDE generates the dependencies configured in the `pom.xml` for the project. 

To import a shareable JAR file in your desktop IDE:

. Ensure that no project is open in the IDE.
// include for this procedure
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="open-command-palette-desktop"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-shareable-jar"]
. If your Mule project folder is closed, <<both-open-project-folder, open a workspace>> for the project at the project's _root_ directory.

[[desktop-project-folder]]
=== Import a Project Folder into the Desktop IDE

Although it is more common to import a shareable JAR file or to open a project workspace from file directory, you can also drag a Mule project folder into the Explorer view and open the project in a VS Code workspace.

Open any valid project folder, including a project from Anypoint Studio (Studio) that's stored on your desktop. Alternatively, use the procedure in <<both-open-project-folder>> to open the project from your file directory instead of dragging and dropping the folder into the IDE.

To import a project folder to the desktop IDE:

. Ensure that no project is open in the IDE.
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="import-project-folder-desktop"]
. If your Mule project folder is closed, <<both-open-project-folder, open a workspace>> for the project at the project's _root_ directory.

== Import and Open a Project in the Cloud IDE

The cloud IDE enables you to upload a project directory or JAR file into a workspace.

* <<web-project-package>>
* <<web-project-folder>>
* <<both-open-project-folder>>


//WEB: PACKAGED PROJECT TO WORKSPACE
[[web-project-package]]
=== Import a Shareable Project JAR File into the Cloud IDE

Import a JAR file for a Mule project and load the unpacked project into a workspace in the IDE.

. Ensure that no project is open in the cloud IDE.
//includes first 2 steps, shared cloud steps
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="preliminary-cloud-import-steps"]
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the directory.
+
Anypoint Code Builder loads your directory.
. Drag your shareable JAR file from your computer to the Explorer view in the cloud IDE, for example:
+
image::int-drag-jar-cloud.png["Drag a JAR file to the Explorer view in the cloud IDE"]
+
If prompted, trust the authors of your file or directory.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not click *Open Anyway* in response to this warning in the IDE: `This file is not displayed in the text editor because it is either binary or uses an unsupported encoding.`
+
If the imported folder is large, Anypoint Code Builder displays an upload progress bar that you can click to expand.

. Navigate to and select the shareable JAR file to import.
. Navigate to a destination folder for your unpacked project, such as your home directory or any folder _outside_ of a Mule project folder, and click *OK*.

The IDE unpacks the shareable JAR file for your project into the selected folder.
. If your Mule project folder is closed, <<both-open-project-folder, open a workspace>> for the project at the project's _root_ directory.

[[both-open-project-folder]]
== Open a Project Folder from the Desktop or Cloud IDE

Open or reopen a project workspace folder for your application. This procedure works for projects built in Anypoint Code Builder and for projects stored on your desktop that are built in Anypoint Studio (Studio). 

To import a project folder from Studio into your cloud IDE, use the procedure in <<web-project-folder>>.

// include for this procedure

include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-project"]
