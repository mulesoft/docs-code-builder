Debug your Mule application using the embedded debugger in Anypoint Code Builder. 


The process for debugging a Mule app is:

.  <<add-breakpoint, Set breakpoints>> to pause the execution of a flow at lines that you want to inspect or fix.
+
Breakpoints are markers that you add on line numbers in a configuration XML file for a Mule application that you are developing.
. <<run-debug-mode, Run the application in debug mode>>.
. Start execution of a flow in your Mule application.
+
For example, trigger an HTTP Listener or configure a Scheduler component.
. When the execution stops at a breakpoint, use the <<debug-toolbar, debug toolbar>> to navigate, inspect, and fix issues.
. After addressing an issue at a breakpoint, redeploy (<<hot-deploy, hot deploy>>) the running instance of your application.
. Execute your flow again, and continue debugging until you address all issues.
. <<stop-debug, Stop the debug session>>.

. *Start Debugging*: Starts an instance of a Mule application in debugging mode.
. *Debug Toolbar*: Controls debugging of Mule applications.
+
See <<debug-toolbar>>.

. *Run and Debug* (MuleSoft) icon: Opens the *Run and Debug* panel, where you can click *Start Debugging (F5)* and find debugging information.
+
Keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Shift+d (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+d (Windows) 
. *Watch* panel: Helps you evaluate variables and expressions.
. *Call Stack* panel: Identifies the functions or procedures that are currently in the stack.
. *Breakpoints* panel: Lists all breakpoints in your Mule application.
. *Terminal* console: Displays the output of the Maven build process and the results of the deployment to the embedded Mule Runtime engine.
. *Breakpoint* icon: Identifies a line in the configuration XML to pause execution of the flow so that you can check for and fix any issues.
. *Breakpoint* icon: Identifies a component that contains one or more breakpoints.


[[add-breakpoint]]
== Add a Breakpoint

A breakpoint enables you to pause your Mule application at a specific place to learn more about what is happening. You can either add a breakpoint to a configuration XML file or to a component in the canvas UI.

=== Add a Breakpoint in a Configuration File

To add a breakpoint in a configuration XML file:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, on the Explorer view, open your configuration XML file, for example, `my-project-name.xml`.
// Pointer to Run and Debug
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-run-debug"]
. Click the line number in your `<flow-ref>` component to add a breakpoint on that component:
+
image::deb-add-breakpoint.png["Add breakpoint on a line number"]
+
You can also use F9 to add a breakpoint to the current line.
. In your configuration XML file, add two more breakpoints for the `<db:select>` and the `<set-variable>` components.
+
All breakpoints appear in the *Breakpoints* panel:
+
image::int-breakpoints-panel.png["Breakpoints panel"]

=== Add a Breakpoint to a Component in the Canvas UI

To add a breakpoint to a component in the canvas UI:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, on the Explorer view, open your configuration XML file, for example, `flights-implementation.xml`.
// Pointer to Run and Debug
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-run-debug"]

. In the canvas UI, right-click on the component you want to add a breakpoint to:
+
image::debug-add-breakpoint-canvas.png["Add breakpoint to a component in the canvas UI"]

. Select *Add Breakpoint*.
+
A breakpoint icon appears on the component, and in the configuration XML for that component.

[[run-debug-mode]]
== Run Your Application in Debug Mode

After setting up your debug conditions, run a debug session and evaluate your Mule application at each breakpoint:

// Pointer to Run and Debug
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-run-debug"]
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="deploy-locally"]

NOTE: Selecting *Run* > *Start without Debugging* produces an error.

Anypoint Code Builder packages your application and deploys the application to the embedded Mule runtime engine.
A terminal opens so you can view the status:

image::deb-terminal-running.png["Debugging status in a terminal window"]

The terminal displays a message and the status bar turns red to indicate that the application is running.

Use buttons on the <<debug-toolbar, debug toolbar>> to control debugging of Mule applications.

[calloutlist]
. *Continue* F5
+
Proceeds to the next breakpoint, if present, and pauses execution of the application.
Otherwise, continues to the end of the application.
. *Step Over* F10
+
Proceeds to the next component in the flow, where execution pauses.
At a Flow Ref component (`<flow-ref/>`), clicking *Step Over* proceeds to the next component in the flow but _does not_ follow the Flow Ref logic to a referenced flow or proceed to another flow. 
+
.Step Over Details

*Configuration XML example*:
[source,xml]
----
<flow name="flow1" doc:name="Flow" >
  <http:listener path="greet" config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" doc:name="Listener"/>
  <flow-ref name="myNewFlow" /> <!--1-->
  <logger doc:name="Logger1" message="test1"/> <!--2-->
</flow>

<flow name="flow2" doc:name="Flow" >
  <logger doc:name="Logger2" message="test2"/>
</flow>
----
*Step Over behavior*:
[calloutlist]
. Skips `<flow-ref/>` logic
. Reaches `<logger/>` named `Logger1`
====
. *Step Into* F11
+
Proceeds to the next component in the flow, where execution pauses.
At a Flow Ref component (`<flow-ref/>`), clicking *Step Into* follows the logic of the component and proceeds to the first component in the referenced flow. If a component in a flow follows a Flow Ref component, *Step Into* returns to that component after the last component in the referenced flow (or flows).

*Configuration XML example*:

<flow name="flow1" doc:name="Flow" >
  <http:listener path="greet" config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" doc:name="Listener"/>

<flow name="myNewFlow" doc:name="Flow" >
  <logger doc:name="Logger2" message="test2"/> <!--2-->
</flow>
----
*Step Into behavior*:
[calloutlist]
. Enters `<flow-ref/>` to follow logic to `myNewFlow`
. Reaches `Logger2` in next flow, `myNewFlow`
. Returns to flow `flow1` to reach `Logger1`
====
. *Step Out* Shift+F11
+
Exits the current flow and attempts to return to a previous flow. If a previous flow doesn't exist, the debugger behaves like *Continue*.
. *Restart* Shift+Cmd+F5 (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+F5 (Windows)
+ 
Stop and restart the application without packaging new dependencies, such as new connector dependencies in your `pom.xml` file. 
. *Stop* Shift+F5
+
Stop execution of the application. The next debugging session that you start packages the application with any new dependencies.

[[hot-deploy]]
== Perform a Hot Deploy When Debugging

As you debug your application, periodically perform a hot deployment.
A hot deployment updates a running instance of your application but does not package new dependencies, such as new connector dependencies in your `pom.xml`.

To perform a hot deploy:

. Ensure your Mule application is running in the IDE.
. Make an update to your application.
. Click the *Save and Hot-deploy to Mule Runtime* (lightning) icon to deploy the application with the change:
+
image::deb-hot-deploy.png["Hot-deploy (lightning) icon in a running Mule application"]


[[stop-debug]]
== Stop a Debug Session

To stop your debug session, in the *Run and Debug* panel, click the image:icon-stop.png["",15,15] (*Stop*) icon. 

The status bar no longer indicates that the application is running.
