= Enable Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder

As an Anypoint Platform Organization Administrator, you can enable the Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder generative flows feature so that everyone in your Anypoint Platform organization can send requests to Einstein through the Salesforce organization you select. 

== Before you Begin

Before enabling Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder, you must:

* Be familiar with the concept of Salesforce And Anypoint Platform organizations.  
* xref:access-management::trusted-salesforce-org.adoc[Establish a tenant relationship between your Anypoint Platform organization and trusted Salesforce organization] that has Einstein enabled. 
+
When you enable Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder, you select the Salesforce organization to route the Einstein requests through. The list of available Salesforce orgs is populated with Salesforce orgs with established tenant relationships.

If you don't have a tenant relationship established with a Salesforce organization, there is a Salesforce trial organization you can select when you enable Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder, however, it is only available until October 19, 2024. It's best to select your own private Salesforce organization to avoid service disruption. If you don't have a Salesforce organization with Einstein enabled, contact your AE (???).

Using your own Salesforce organization has these advantages:

* You can store your Einstein generative AI audit and feedback data in Data Cloud. You can use that data for compliance, analytics, prompt adjustments, and LLM tuning to enhance your generative AI applications.
* You aren't subject to the rate limiting policies of the trial organization, which can sometimes result in the service being too busy to process Einstein requests.
