= Enable Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder

Anypoint Platform Organization Administrators establish a connection with a trusted Salesforce organization in Anypoint Platform access management, and then enable the Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder feature for their Anypoint Platform organization. 

== Before you Begin

Before enabling Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder, you must:

* Be familiar with the concept of Salesforce And Anypoint Platform organizations.  
* xref:access-management::trusted-salesforce-org.adoc[Establish a connection between your Anypoint Platform organization and a trusted Salesforce organization] that has Einstein enabled. 
+
When you enable Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder, you select the Salesforce organization to route the Einstein requests through.  

The list of available Salesforce orgs is populated with Salesforce orgs that are connected to your Anypoint Platform organization.

If you don't have a connection established with a Salesforce organization, there is a Salesforce trial organization you can select when you enable Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder, however, it's best to select your own private Salesforce organization to avoid service disruption. If you don't have a Salesforce organization with Einstein enabled, contact your AE (???).

Using your own private Salesforce organization has these advantages:

* You can store your Einstein generative AI audit and feedback data in Data Cloud. You can use that data for compliance, analytics, prompt adjustments, and LLM tuning to enhance your generative AI applications.
* You aren't subject to the rate-limiting policies of the trial organization, which can sometimes result in the service being too busy to process Einstein requests.
