Run, modify, and create MUnit tests for your implementation and integration projects in Anypoint Code Builder. Import projects that contain MUnit test files. 

MUnit is a MuleSoft unit testing framework for creating and running unit tests on a Mule application, as described in xref:munit::index.adoc[MUnit Overview]. 

Anypoint Code Builder provides a Testing panel from which you can run tests. In the Explorer, test suites are also located within the project directory `{munit-src}`. The IDE also provides a Testing Results panel that provides the status of tests and logs that identify the status of tests that you run. 

//TODO TO SELF: TEST LINKS LOCALLY -- RESOURCES NOT BUILT ON REVIEW SITE
For MUnit features supported by Anypoint Code Builder, see xref:acb-release-notes.adoc[Anypoint Code Builder Release Notes]. xref:studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] also supports MUnit testing features.

//TODO: ADD MAVEN VERSION MINIMUM TO 

[[prereqs]]
== Before You Begin

Understand the fundamentals of MUnit. Refer to the MUnit documentation for an overview and guidance with test configurations:

* xref:munit::index.adoc[MUnit Overview]
* xref:munit::munit-test-concept.adoc[]
* xref:munit::event-processors.adoc[]
* xref:munit::munit-cookbook.adoc[]

//
For MUnit features supported by Anypoint Code Builder, see xref:acb-release-notes.adoc[]. Anypoint Studio supports testing with all MUnit features.

//
//MUNIT WORKFLOWS AND TASKS
[[workflow]]
== MUnit Tasks and Workflows

A typical workflow includes one or more of the following steps:

. <<open-test, Opening tests>>
. <<run, Running tests>>
. <<run-debug, Debugging>>
. <<fix-errors, Fixing errors>>

If your project does not contain any tests, Anypoint Code Builder supports the following tasks:

* <<import-test, Importing a project that contains MUnit tests>>
* <<create-tests, Creating tests or test suites in an existing project>>

//
//OPEN MUNIT TESTS
[[open-test]]
== Open MUnit Tests

Open the test suite XML from the Testing panel or the Explorer. 

* *Testing panel* - Open the Testing panel from the activity bar in the IDE:
//open project (with tests) step as local variable
. {open-project} 
. Click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-testing.png["",18,18] (Testing) icon to open the Testing panel.
. Click or mouse over the suite or test name, and click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-go-to-test-gray.png["",18,18] or highlighted image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-go-to-test.png["",18,18] (Go to test) icon to open the XML file that contains the test. For example:
+
image::anypoint-code-builder::munit-tests-panel.png["MUnit tests in the Testing panel"] 
+
//TODO: BUT YOU CAN'T RUN THE TEST FROM THE XML IN THIS CASE :(
Clicking the test name also opens to the XML file. 

* *Explorer* - From the Explorer, locate MUnit test suite files in the project directory:
//open project (with tests) step as local variable
. {open-project}
. In the activity bar, click the (image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-explorer.png["",18,18]) (Explorer) icon. 
. Navigate to `src/main/test/munit`. For example:
+
image::anypoint-code-builder::munit-tests-explorer.png["MUnit tests in the Explorer"]
. Click a test suite XML file to view the tests in the suite. 

//
//RUN MUNIT TESTS
[[run]]
== Run MUnit Tests

Run MUnit tests using any of these options:

* <<run-test-panel>>
* <<run-test-xml>>
* <<run-launch-config>>
* <<run-debug>>
//TODO: CONSIDER ADDING WHEN WORKING (SECTION REMOVED UNTIL THEN)
//* <<run-test-explorer>>

When you run a test, a test build executes, and the Terminal displays the progress of the test. If all tests execute successfully the build succeeds. Otherwise, the build fails. 

The IDE displays the results of the tests in the Testing panel, the *Terminal* and the Test Results panels. Time-stamped logs are also available from the Test Results panel. You can clear the results at any time.

//
//RUN: FROM TEST PANEL
[[run-test-panel]]
=== Run Tests from the Testing Panel

Run all tests, all tests in a suite, or a single test from the Testing panel. The Testing panel lists all MUnit test suites in the project.

//RUN: LAUNCH CONFIG
[[run-launch-config]]
=== Run Tests with an MUnit Launch Configuration

Run MUnit tests from the Run and Debug panel with an MUnit launch configuration. 

[[launch-json-manual]]
Create and run an MUnit launch configuration:
 
//step to open run&debug panel:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-run-debug"]
. Add a launch configuration to `launch.json`: 
.. Click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-gear.png["",18,18] (gear) icon to open the *launch.json* tab.
+
The default configuration looks something like this:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "type": "mule-xml-debugger",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Debug Mule Application",
        "mule.project": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "mule.home": "${config:mule.runtime.muleHome}",
        "mule.runtime.args": "${config:mule.runtime.defaultArguments}"
      }
    ]
  }
----
.. In the `launch.json` file, add a comma after the first object in the array, and append the MUnit launch configuration by pressing Ctrl+Space to open the auto-complete menu and selecting *MUnit Debug Launch*. For example:
+
image:munit-launch-config-autocomplete.png["Adding launch configuration for MUnit from the auto-complete menu"]
+
This action adds a new JSON object named `Munit Debug Tests` to the file. For example:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "type": "mule-xml-debugger", <1>
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Debug Mule Application",
        "mule.project": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "mule.home": "${config:mule.runtime.muleHome}",
        "mule.runtime.args": "${config:mule.runtime.defaultArguments}"
      },
      {
        "type": "munit-xml-debugger", <2>
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Munit Run Tests",
        "mule.project": "${workspaceFolder}",

      }
    ]
  }
----
+
--
[calloutlist]
.. Launcher for the standard debugger, named `Debug Mule Application`.
.. Launcher for the MUnit debugger, named `Munit Run Tests`.
--
. Save the configuration to `launch.json`.
. Run MUnit tests from the *MUnit Debug Tests* launch configuration:
.. In the Run and Debug panel, select *MUnit Debug Tests* from the launch menu. For example:
+
image:munit-launch-config-munit.png["Selecting *MUnit Debug Tests* from the launch menu"]
.. Execute *MUnit Debug Tests* by clicking the image:icon-start-debug.png["",18,18] (launch) button in the Run an Debug panel.
. Verify that the MUnit tests run. See the <<results-example, example>>.

//
//RUN: DEBUG
[[run-debug]]
== Run MUnit Tests in Debug Mode

Run your test in debug mode after adding breakpoints to the XML for your tests or Mule application. When Mule reaches the breakpoint, you can review variables in the Run and Debug panel. 

//open project (with tests) step as local variable
. {open-project} 
. Add breakpoints to the XML for the Mule application or test suites. 
+
For guidance with breakpoints and the Mule event, see xref:int-debug-mule-apps.adoc[].
. Run your test with a debugging command using one of the following options:

* From the Testing panel, click a image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-run-debug.png["",18,18] (Debug test) icon at any level (all tests, all tests in a suite, or a single test).
+
For more guidance, see <<run-test-panel>>.
* From the suite XML, use the right-click menu to run the text. 
+
For more guidance, see <<run-test-xml>>.
* From a launch configuration in the Run and Debug panel. 
+
For guidance, see <<run-launch-config>>.

. When the build process reaches a breakpoint, click the image:icon-run-debug.png["",18,18] (Run and Debug panel) icon from the activity bar to review variables, including the Mule event variables and test parameters. For example:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-debug-test-mule-event.png["Variables after debugging test with breakpoints"]
//TODO: VERIFY STEP, ANYTHING TO ADD?
. Examine the data, and address any issues.

By default, running tests fail after a timeout period. If a debugging session reaches a breakpoint in a test, the test and the build fails at timeout. See xref:munit::munit-test-concept.adoc#test-timeout-attribute[Test TimeOut Attribute]. 

//
//FIX ERRORS
[[fix-errors]]
== Fix Test Errors

After <<run, running a test>>, fix any errors.

. Review test errors in the XML by clicking a failing test's name from the Testing panel. 
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-test-panel-failed-test.png["All test results displayed in Testing panel and with an error highlighted in the XML"]
//TODO: TO SELF - HIDING: ALREADY EMBEDDED IN IMAGE ABOVE -REMOVE?
//image:icon-munit-open-failed-test.png["Opening failed test from Test panel"]
+
The error in the XML example identifies the error `java.lang.AssertionError`.

* Expected result (highlighted in red):
+
----
"yes" as String {encoding: "UTF-8", mediaType: "application/java; 
                 charset=UTF-8", mimeType: "application/java", 
                class: "java.lang.String", contentLength: 3}
----

* Actual result (highlighted in green):
+
----
"no" as String {encoding: "UTF-8", mediaType: "application/java; 
                charset=UTF-8", mimeType: "application/java", 
                class: "java.lang.String", contentLength: 2} at (root)
----
+
You can also review the test results in the Test Results panel by clicking the failing test in the test logs. For example:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-test-results-panel-failed.png["Error in the Test Results panel"]
. Fix the error:
.. After reviewing the error, click the *x* icon to close the error message in the XML. For example:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-test-error-xml-close.png["Closing test error messages in the XML"]
.. Edit the XML to produce the expected output.
+
For example, the failing test case in the example must return `"yes"` instead of `"no"`.
. After fixing the error, rerun the test to ensure that the fix works:

* To rerun the test from the XML, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-failed-test.png["",18,18] (Test failure) icon for the test.

* To rerun the test from the Testing panel, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-run-test.png["",18,18] (Run test) icon. 

* To rerun the test fro the Testing Results panel, open the panel, click the failing test in the test logs, and click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-run-test.png["",18,18] (Run test) icon from the test logs. 
. Make sure that the test passes. For example:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-tests-results-pass.png["Successful test in the Test Results panel"]
