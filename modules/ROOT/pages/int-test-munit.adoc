Run, modify, and create MUnit tests for your implementation and integration projects in Anypoint Code Builder. Import projects that contain MUnit test files. 

MUnit is a MuleSoft unit testing framework for creating and running unit tests on a Mule application, as described in xref:munit::index.adoc[MUnit Overview]. 

Anypoint Code Builder provides a *Testing* panel from which you can run tests. In the *Explorer*, test suites are also located within the project directory `{munit-src}`. The IDE also provides a Testing Results panel that provides the status of tests and logs that identify the status of tests that you run. 

//TODO TO SELF: TEST LINKS LOCALLY -- RESOURCES NOT BUILT ON REVIEW SITE
For MUnit features supported by Anypoint Code Builder, see xref:acb-release-notes.adoc[Anypoint Code Builder Release Notes]. xref:studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] also supports MUnit testing features.

Anypoint Code Builder - MUnit Extension, part of the Anypoint Extension Pack, supports MUnit functionality in Anypoint Code Builder. For information about extensions, see xref:index.adoc#extension-pack[Anypoint Extension Pack].
//TODO: ADD MAVEN VERSION MINIMUM TO 

[[prereqs]]
== Before You Begin

* Configure the settings required to run MUnit. 
+
For guidance, see <<maven-settings>>.

* Understand the fundamentals of MUnit. Refer to the MUnit documentation for an overview and guidance with test configurations:

** xref:munit::index.adoc[MUnit Overview]
** xref:munit::munit-test-concept.adoc[]
** xref:munit::event-processors.adoc[]
** xref:munit::munit-cookbook.adoc[]

For MUnit features supported by Anypoint Code Builder, see xref:acb-release-notes.adoc[]. Anypoint Studio supports testing with all MUnit features.


//
//MUNIT SETTINGS
[[maven-settings]]
== Configure Access to MUnit Features

Make MUnit resources available to your project. The process differs depending on whether you have a Mule enterprise edition (EE) license.

* <<configure-settings-license-yes>>:
+
If you have a Mule EE license (_not a trial license_), configure `server` credentials settings in the Maven file, `settings.xml`. 

* <<configure-settings-license-no>>:
+
If you _don't have_ a Mule EE license or if your license is a trial license, configure your `mule-artifact.json` for the project. This option uses the Mule Kernel (formerly, Mule Community Edition) to run the tests. 

[[configure-settings-license-yes]]
=== Configure Maven Settings (Licensed Access)

If you have a Mule EE license (_not a trial license_), configure `server` credentials  in the Maven file, `settings.xml`.

See xref:mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Install an Enterprise License], to acquire or install an Enterprise license. If you are a MuleSoft customer and do not have credentials to access the https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus-ee/content/repositories/releases-ee/[MuleSoft Enterprise repository^], contact Support and request Nexus enterprise credentials.

//navigate to settings.xml:
. {empty}
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-maven-settings.adoc[tag=nav-to-maven-settings]
. Specify `server` settings with your Mule username and password _within_ `<servers></servers>`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <username>yourMuleUsername</username>
  <password>yourMulePassword</password>
  <id>releases-ee</id>
</server>
----
//set releases ee repo:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-maven-settings.adoc[tag="pom-releases-ee"]

[[configure-settings-license-no]]
=== Configure Maven Settings (Unlicensed Access)

If you do not own a Mule Enterprise Edition (EE) license or if your license is a trial license, configure your `mule-artifact.json` for the project.

. Open your project in the *Explorer*.
. In the `mule-artifact.json` file for your project, add the key-value pair `"requiredProduct" : "MULE"` to the existing configuration. For example:
+
[[source,json]]
----
{
    "minMuleVersion": "4.6.2",
    "javaSpecificationVersions": [
        "11"
    ],
    "requiredProduct" : "MULE"
}
----

For more information about Maven settings, see xref:ref-acb-maven.adoc[].

//MUNIT WORKFLOWS AND TASKS
[[workflow]]
== MUnit Tasks and Workflows

A typical workflow includes one or more of the following steps:

. <<maven-settings>>
. <<open-test, Opening tests>>
. <<run, Running tests>>
. <<run-debug, Debugging>>
. <<fix-errors, Fixing errors>>

If your project does not contain any tests, Anypoint Code Builder supports the following tasks:

* <<import-test, Importing a project that contains MUnit tests>>
* <<create-tests, Creating tests or test suites in an existing project>>

//
//OPEN MUNIT TESTS
[[open-test]]
== Open MUnit Tests

Open the test suite XML from the *Testing* panel or the *Explorer*.

* *Testing panel* - Open the *Testing* panel from the activity bar in the IDE:
//open project (with tests) step as local variable
. {open-project} 
. Click image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-testing.png["",18,18] (*Testing*) to open the *Testing* panel.
. Click or mouse over the suite or test name, and click image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-go-to-test-gray.png["",18,18] or highlighted image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-go-to-test.png["",18,18] (*Go to test*) to open the XML file that contains the test.
+
//TODO: BUT YOU CAN'T RUN THE TEST FROM THE XML IN THIS CASE :(
Clicking the test name also opens to the XML file. 

* *Explorer* - From the *Explorer*, locate MUnit test suite files in the project directory:
//open project (with tests) step as local variable
. {open-project}
. In the activity bar, click (image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-explorer.png["",18,18]) (*Explorer*). 
. Navigate to `src/main/test/munit`.
. Click a test suite XML file to view the tests in the suite. 

//
//RUN MUNIT TESTS
[[run]]
== Run MUnit Tests

Run MUnit tests using any of these options:

* <<run-test-panel>>
* <<run-test-xml>>
* <<run-launch-config>>
* <<run-debug>>
* <<run-coverage>>
//TODO: CONSIDER ADDING WHEN WORKING (SECTION REMOVED UNTIL THEN)
//* <<run-test-explorer>>

When you run a test, a test build executes, and the Terminal displays the progress of the test. If all tests execute successfully the build succeeds. Otherwise, the build fails. 

The IDE displays the results of the tests in the *Testing* panel, the *Terminal*, and the *Test Results* panels. Time-stamped logs are also available from the *Test Results* panel. You can clear the results at any time.

//
//RUN: FROM TEST PANEL
[[run-test-panel]]
=== Run Tests from the Testing Panel

Run all tests, all tests in a suite, or a single test from the *Testing* panel. The *Testing* panel lists all MUnit test suites in the project.

//RUN: LAUNCH CONFIG
[[run-launch-config]]
=== Run Tests with an MUnit Launch Configuration

Run MUnit tests from the Run and Debug panel with an MUnit launch configuration. 

[[launch-json-manual]]
Create and run an MUnit launch configuration:
 
//step to open run&debug panel:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-run-debug"]
. Add a launch configuration to `launch.json`: 
.. Click image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-gear.png["",18,18] (gear icon) to open the *launch.json* tab.
+
The default configuration looks something like this:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "type": "mule-xml-debugger",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Debug Mule Application",
        "mule.project": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "mule.runtime.args": "${config:mule.runtime.defaultArguments}"
      }
    ]
  }
----
.. In the `launch.json` file, add a comma after the first object in the array, and append the MUnit launch configuration by pressing Ctrl+Space to open the auto-complete menu and selecting *MUnit Debug Launch*. For example:
+
image:munit-launch-config-autocomplete.png["Adding launch configuration for MUnit from the auto-complete menu"]
+
This action adds a new JSON object named `Munit Debug Tests` to the file. For example:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "type": "mule-xml-debugger", <1>

. Save the configuration to `launch.json`.
. Run MUnit tests from the *MUnit Debug Tests* launch configuration:
.. In the Run and Debug panel, select *MUnit Debug Tests* from the launch menu. For example:
+
image:munit-launch-config-munit.png["Selecting *MUnit Debug Tests* from the launch menu"]
.. Execute *MUnit Debug Tests* by clicking image:icon-start-debug.png["",18,18] (launch) in the *Run an Debug* panel.
. Verify that the MUnit tests run. See the <<results-example, example>>.

//
//RUN: DEBUG
[[run-debug]]
== Run MUnit Tests in Debug Mode

Run your test in debug mode after adding breakpoints to the XML for your tests or Mule application. When Mule reaches the breakpoint, you can review variables in the Run and Debug panel. 

This procedure requires the Enterprise Edition of Mule runtime engine (Mule). For licensing information, see xref:mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Install an Enterprise License].

//open project (with tests) step as local variable
. {open-project} 
. Add breakpoints to the XML for the Mule application or test suites. 
+
For guidance with breakpoints and the Mule event, see xref:int-debug-mule-apps.adoc[].
. Run your test with a debugging command using one of the following options:

* From the *Testing* panel, click image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-run-debug.png["",18,18] (*Debug test*) at any level (all tests, all tests in a suite, or a single test).
+
For more guidance, see <<run-test-panel>>.
* From the suite XML, use the right-click menu to run the test.
+
For more guidance, see <<run-test-xml>>.
* From a launch configuration in the Run and Debug panel. 
+
For guidance, see <<run-launch-config>>.

. When the build process reaches a breakpoint, click image:icon-run-debug.png["",18,18] (*Run and Debug*) from the activity bar to review variables, including the Mule event variables and test parameters. For example:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-debug-test-mule-event.png["Variables after debugging test with breakpoints"]
//TODO: VERIFY STEP, ANYTHING TO ADD?
. Examine the data, and address any issues.

By default, running tests fail after a timeout period. If a debugging session reaches a breakpoint in a test, the test and the build fail at timeout. See xref:munit::munit-test-concept.adoc#test-timeout-attribute[Test TimeOut Attribute].

//
//RUN: COVERAGE
[[run-coverage]]
== Run MUnit Tests with Coverage

Run your test with coverage to measure how much of a Mule application has been executed by a set of MUnit tests.

This procedure requires the Enterprise Edition of Mule runtime engine (Mule). For licensing information, see xref:mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Install an Enterprise License].

//open project (with tests) step as local variable
. {open-project}
. Run your test with coverage using one of the following options:

* From the *Testing* panel, click *Run Test with Coverage* at any level (all tests, all tests in a suite, or a single test).
+
For more guidance, see <<run-test-panel>>.
* From the suite XML, use the right-click menu to run the test.
+
For more guidance, see <<run-test-xml>>.

. After the test suite runs, view coverage results using one of the following options:

* In the activity bar, click image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-testing.png["",18,18] (*Testing*) to open the *Testing* panel. The *Test Coverage* panel shows coverage for directories and files:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-test-coverage-panel.png["Test coverage percentages after running tests with coverage"]

* In the activity bar, click (image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-explorer.png["",18,18]) (*Explorer*). Coverage is shown for directories and files.

Numeric and graphic percentages both indicate the percentage of event processors executed by the MUnit test.

//
//FIX ERRORS
[[fix-errors]]
== Fix Test Errors

After <<run, running a test>>, fix any errors.

. Review test errors in the XML by clicking a failing test's name from the *Testing* panel.
+
The error in the XML example identifies the error `java.lang.AssertionError`.

* Expected result (highlighted in red):
+
----
"yes" as String {encoding: "UTF-8", mediaType: "application/java; 
                 charset=UTF-8", mimeType: "application/java", 
                class: "java.lang.String", contentLength: 3}
----

* Actual result (highlighted in green):
+
----
"no" as String {encoding: "UTF-8", mediaType: "application/java; 
                charset=UTF-8", mimeType: "application/java", 
                class: "java.lang.String", contentLength: 2} at (root)
----
+
You can also review the test results in the *Test Results* panel by clicking the failing test in the test logs. For example:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-test-results-panel-failed.png["Error in the Test Results panel"]
. Fix the error:
.. After reviewing the error, click the *x* icon to close the error message in the XML. For example:
+
image:anypoint-code-builder::munit-test-error-xml-close.png["Closing test error messages in the XML"]
.. Edit the XML to produce the expected output.
+
For example, the failing test case in the example must return `"yes"` instead of `"no"`.
. After fixing the error, rerun the test to ensure that the fix works:

* To rerun the test from the XML, click image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-failed-test.png["",18,18] (*Test failure*) for the test.

* To rerun the test from the *Testing* panel, click image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-run-test.png["",18,18] (*Run test*). 

* To rerun the test from the Testing Results panel, open the panel, click the failing test in the test logs, and click image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-run-test.png["",18,18] (*Run test*) from the test logs.

For guidance with MUnit XML configurations, see xref:munit::munit-test-concept.adoc[] and xref:munit::event-processors.adoc[].
