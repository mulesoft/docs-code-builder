Use the built-in integrated source control management (SCM) to sync American Flights API with Anypoint Design Center (Design Center). The Design Center SCM is built on Git.

== Before You Begin

Before synchronizing with Design Center:

. xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[Create an API specification].
// . xref:des-add-examples-to-specs.adoc[Add examples to your specification].
. xref:des-test-api-specs.adoc[Test your API specification using mocking service].



[[review]]
== Review Changes in Files

Identify changes to files in your API project since the last synchronization with the main branch in Design Center. When you change your API project, the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar identifies the number of changes to the API project. 

//TODO duke: hamburger menu present; maybe ok since it's fairly inobtrusive

To review changes to your API project:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the *Source Control* menu.
+
[%collapsible]
====
* Mac: Ctrl+Shift+g
* Windows: Cmd+Shift+g

Alternatively, click the *Source Control* icon in the activity bar.
====
. Open your `exchange.json` file.
. Review the working tree and notice the shading for deletions (red) and additions (green).

+
This example adds some dependencies to the API specification by reusing the API fragments downloaded from Anypoint Exchange.
. Proceed to <<stage>>.

[[stage]]
== Stage Changes to the Built-in SCM

Stage changes from one or more files from the UI or through the command line, with a Git command. The UI uses the `git add` command to add changes from your working directory to the staging area. This area includes updates for the next commit.

* <<stage-one>>
* <<stage-multiple>>

[[stage-one]]
=== Stage Changes to a Single File

To stage individual changes through the UI:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. Select the plus icon beside your RAML specification file, such as `american-flight-api.raml`.
+
The file moves to *Staged Changes* section.
. Review the changes in the Source Control section.
. Proceed to <<stage-multiple>> to stage changes to more than one file in your API project.

[[stage-multiple]]
=== Stage Changes to Multiple Files

Stage multiple files at the same time:

. Select your Source Control view for your API project.
. Click the plus icon in the *Changes* header to stage your remaining changes.
+
image::stage-all-changes.png["Plus icon highlighted to stage all changes"]
. Proceed to <<commit>>.

[[commit]]
== Commit Changes

The UI uses the `git commit` command to save the changes you staged to your local repository. 

To commit staged changes:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. In the message field, summarize your changes, and click *Commit*.
+
image::add-commit-message.png["Message box highlighted"]
. Your Source Control view now displays no changes to commit.
. Proceed to <<push>>.

[[push]]
== Push Changes to Anypoint Design Center

Use the `git push` command from the UI to upload your local content to Design Center.

To push your changes:

. Open the Source Control view.
. In the *Source Control* header, click the More actions menu (ellipsis).
. Select *Push*.
+
//TODO duke: hamburger in screenshot; does Sync Changes appear?
image::push-changes.png["Push command highlighted in the source control section"]
+
Your changes are now published in Design Center.
+
If the UI prompts you to `periodically run 'git fetch'`, indicate whether to check for updates of your API in Design Center and prompt you to update your local version of the API.
+

. Proceed to xref:tut-design-api-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[] so that your team can find and implement the specification.
