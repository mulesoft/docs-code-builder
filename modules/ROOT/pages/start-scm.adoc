= Controlling Source Files
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide
:no-repo-yet: If you have a project in Anypoint Code Builder but do not have a repo for that project, you can use the IDE to generate a repo in GitHub and publish your project files to that remote repo. The process also implicitly initializes a local repo in the IDE.
:init-local: Initializing and committing your project files into a local repo in the IDE is a prerequisite to publishing and syncing files into a remote repo in GitHub.
:repo-in-github: If you have an empty repo in GitHub, you can publish your project files to the repo from the IDE.
:extra-repo: If your project is already configured to sync with a remote repo, you can configure the IDE to publish your project files to a different repo. 
:extra-repo-continued: This feature is helpful, for example, if you want to use your own repo for an API spec project that you imported from Design Center or if you created your design project from the IDE before the February 2024 release. Both types of projects automatically add a connection to a remote Git repo in the Anypoint SCM.

// Shared intro to SCM
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="scm-intro-best-practice"]
A useful SCM provides change history of each file and a branching methodology to maintain project quality, full traceability, the ability to restore earlier versions of your files, and a way to recover source code if your Anypoint Code Builder environment is lost or removed. 

GitHub and the Git command line interface (CLI) are widely used in the industry and supported by VS Code out-of-the-box, with minimal configuration, in the desktop and cloud IDE. The procedures on this page show how to set up and use GitHub for source control. VS Code extensions for other SCM systems are also available for you to set up and use. For information, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_scm-providers[SCM Providers^]. 

For more information, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview[Using Git source control in VS Code^] in the VS Code documentation. For detailed information about Git, see the https://git-scm.com/book[Git documentation^].

[[prereqs]]
== Before You Begin

Ensure that these prerequisites are in place:

* A GitHub account
+
If you do not have an account, create one from the https://github.com/join[Join GitHub^] page on the GitHub site.

* A Git installation on your computer 
+
If Git is not installed on your computer, follow the https://github.com/git-guides/install-git[Git installation instructions^] for your machine.

* Access to Anypoint Code Builder from the desktop or cloud IDE
+
For setup and installation information, see xref:start-acb.adoc[], and be sure to meet all prerequisites. 

* A GitHub user name and email configuration (see <<config-git>>)

[[config-git]]
=== Configure Your Git Username and Password

Check for and configure your username and email properties so that you can add, update, and retrieve your project files from a remote Git repo in GitHub. 

. Meet the prerequisites in <<prereqs>>.
//open ACB terminal:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-terminal"]
. From the Anypoint Code Builder terminal, check for any existing Git configuration by running this command:
+
[source,command]
----
git config --list
----

* If your GitHub `user.name` and `user.email` are not listed or if no data returns, configure the properties:

.. Run this command to set your `user.name`, replacing `YourUserName` with your GitHub username:
+
[source,command]
----
git config –-global user.name "YourUserName"
----
.. Run this command to set your `user.email`, replacing `your@email.com` with your GitHub email address:
+
[source,command]
----
git config –-global user.email "your@email.com"
----
+
If two-factor authentication is enabled on your GitHub account and you are prompted for a password, enter your personal access token instead of your GitHub login password. For more information, see GitHub documentation https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication[Access GitHub with 2FA^].

* If your GitHub `user.name` and `user.email` are listed, you are ready to use Git to control your project files from the IDE. For guidance with common source control tasks in VS Code, see: 

** <<set-up-repo>>
** <<sync-changes>>

[[set-up-repo]]
== Set Up a Repository from the IDE

Set up a repo for your design, integration, or implementation project from the IDE. If your project is already set up to sync from the IDE with a repo in an SCM that you want to use, no additional setup is required. You can sync your changes without further setup. For an example, see <<sync-changes>>.

To set up a remote GitHub repo from the IDE for your projects, the following scenarios are common:

* <<create-repo>>
+
//shared info about this procedure:
{no-repo-yet}
* <<initialize-repo>>
+
// shared info about initialization
{init-local}
* <<publish-to-empty>>

//shared info about this procedure:
{repo-in-github}
* <<add-extra-repo>>
+
//shared info about this procedure:
{extra-repo}
//shared description:
{extra-repo-continued}
* <<clone-repo>>
+
If a design, implementation, or integration project is already stored in a repo on GitHub, you can clone it into the cloud or desktop IDE. 

[[create-repo]]
=== Generate and Publish to a Repository in GitHub

//shared info about this procedure:
{no-repo-yet} 
If you already have an empty repo in GitHub that you intend to use for a project in Anypoint Code Builder, see <<publish-to-empty>> to add and publish to the repo from the IDE. 

. Meet the prerequisites in <<prereqs>>.

. In the Source Control panel, click *Publish to GitHub*.
+
image::start-scm-repo.png["Publish repo to GitHub from the IDE"]
+
When no repo is associated with your project, the IDE provides options for initializing a _local_ repo (*Initialize Repository*) on your IDE or directly publishing your project to a new remote repo in GitHub (*Publish to GitHub*). Publishing to GitHub also implicitly initializes your local repo for the project. 
. Provide a name for your repo in the field that opens, or use the default name that appears.
+
image::start-scm-repo-name.png["Name of new repo"]
+
The default repo name matches the project name.
. Select a repo type (private or public).
+
To protect data in your repo, select a private repo (*Publish to GitHub private repo*). This process commits and pushes your project files to your new repo.
. If prompted, select the files to publish to the repo.
+
You can select all or a subset of the files of a design project, for example:
+

You can now clone this project repo in your IDE to easily modify and sync your changes from the IDE's UI. See <<clone-repo>>. 

[[sync-changes]]
== Sync Project Changes with Your Repository 

After your project is connected and published to a remote repo in GitHub, you can use the IDE to sync your changes with that repo. If your repo is not set up yet, see <<set-up-repo>>.

Use the IDE's UI or its built-in terminal to sync your changes:

* <<sync-from-ui>>
* <<sync-from-terminal>>

[[sync-from-ui]]
=== Sync Changes from the Source Control Panel 

To sync changes to your files from your project's Source Control panel in the IDE:

//step: open the project folder
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tag="open-workspace-root"]
// Pointer to Source Control Panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-source-control"]
. In the Source Control panel:
// Shared substep to stage files
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="scm-stage-files-substep"]
// Shared substeps to commit files
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="scm-commit-message-substep"]
.. Click *Sync Changes* to push your changes to your remote repo on GitHub.
. Open the project in GitHub to check for the synced changes.

[[sync-from-terminal]]
=== Sync Changes from the Command Terminal

To sync changes to your files from your project's command terminal in the IDE:

//step: open the project folder
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tag="open-workspace-root"]
//open ACB terminal:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-terminal"]
. At the prompt, run Git commands to add new files to your repo and to stage, commit, and push changes to your remote repo on GitHub.
+
The following example uses `git status` to check the status of changes, `git commit` to commit all changed files and add a commit message, and `git push` to merge the changes into the files on the remote repo.
+
----
$ git status

[[clone-repo]]
== Clone a Project Repository into the IDE

If your design, implementation, or integration project is already stored in a repo on GitHub, you and your team members can clone it into Anypoint Code Builder desktop or cloud IDEs. Cloning is helpful for sharing your project with another IDE, for enabling you to edit source and sync changes from the IDE, and for retrieving a backup of a deleted project. For example, you can work on the same project in the desktop and cloud IDE if your project is stored in a  repo to which you and your team have access.

//open ACB terminal:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-terminal"]
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Clone the repo into the Source Control panel for your project:
.. Provide the following command to add the remote repo on GitHub:
+
[source, command]
----
Git: Clone
----
.. Provide the URL to your repo in GitHub, for example:
+
[source,command]
----
https://github.com/_owner_/_yourrepo_.git
----
+
Replace the URL in the example with the URL to your repo in GitHub. The owner and repo URL are unique to your GitHub site.
.. Navigate to a directory for your new repo, and click *Select as repo Destination*.
.. If prompted with the request *Would you like to open the cloned repository?*, click *Open* to open the project.
+
For cloned integration or implementation projects, you can navigate to `src`-> `main` -> `mule` to find the config XML file or files.

// Link to sync-changes
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="scm-sync-changes"]

[[check-remote]]
== Check for a Remote Repository URL

To determine whether a remote GitHub repo for your project is configured in the IDE, check for a URL to the repo: 

//step: open the project folder
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tag="open-workspace-root"]
//open ACB terminal:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-terminal"]
. Provide the following command:
+
[source, command]
----
git remote -v
----

* If the project has one or more remote repo configurations, the command returns the URL for each remote, along with `push` and `fetch` information, for example:
+
----
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/me/my-project-repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/me/my-project-repo.git (push)
----
* If no results return, a remote repo is not configured for the project.
* If the error `fatal: not a git repo (or any of the parent directories): .git` returns, a local repo is not initialized for the project.

For information about `git remote` command options, see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote[git-remote reference^] in the GitHub documentation.

[[remove-remote]]
== Remove a Remote Repository from Your Project

To remove a remote repo from your project workspace:

//step: open the project folder
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tag="open-workspace-root"]
// Pointer to Source Control Panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-source-control"]
. In the Source Control panel:
.. Provide the following Git command to add the remote repo on GitHub:
+
[source, command]
----
Git: Remove Remote...
----
.. In the popup, select the remote repo that you want to remove.
+
In the IDE, your local Git repo remains because it was initialized before syncing with the remote.
