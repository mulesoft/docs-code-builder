// TODO: How does this work in OAS?

Using Anypoint Code Builder, you can create your own API fragments and publish them to Anypoint Exchange to share with other people,
add fragments from Exchange to your API specification,
or create fragments in your project to add directly to your API specification.
Alternatively, you can create and add a fragment directly in your project without publishing it to Exchange.



The process for adding a fragment from Exchange is:

. <<add-fragment-to-project,Add the API fragment from Exchange>> to your API spec project as a dependency.
. <<add-fragment-to-spec, Add the API fragment to your API spec>> using the `$ref` (OAS) or `!include` (RAML) directives.

The process for adding a fragment without publishing it to Exchange is:

* <<create-add-fragment-directly, Create and add a fragment directly in your project>> without publishing it to Exchange.

Use these examples to explore the functionality of Anypoint Code Builder:

* <<example-oas-api-frag,`example-oas-fragment`>> API spec fragment
* <<example-oas-api-spec,`example-oas-api-spec`>> API spec


== Before You Begin

Before adding fragments:


* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* Understand the basics of designing API specifications. 
+
See the xref:tutorials.adoc[] for details.
* Have some familiarity with xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[business groups].
+
API specifications belong to a business group.
// * xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[Create and test your API specification].


== Create an API Fragment and Publish it to Exchange

The process for creating and publishing API fragments is similar to the process for API specifications.

To create an API fragment:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["Anypoint Code Builder icon highlighted in the activity bar"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Design an API*.
+
image::design-api-1.png["*Design an API* link highlighted in the *Quick Actions* section"]
. In *Design an API*, click the *API Fragment* tab:
+
image:des-api-fragment.png[API Fragment tab on the Design an API page]
+
Ensure that you select the *API Fragment* tab.
. Complete the *API Fragment* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your fragment.

This name is used as the fragment title in Exchange and name of the fragment file.
For example, if the project name is "Example OAS Fragment", the specification file name is `example-oas-fragment`.

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="no-project-name-reuse"]
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create.

See xref:start-add-folders.adoc[].

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="proj-directory-warn"]
| *API Specification Language* | See xref:des-designing-api-specs.adoc#supported-fragment-languages[Supported Specification Languages for API Fragments].

Select *OAS 3.0 (YAML)* to use the <<example-oas-api-frag,example>> in this procedure.| *<Language> Syntax* | The syntax for the selected language.

Select *YAML* to use the <<example-oas-api-frag,example>> in this procedure.
| *Business Group* | Business Group in Anypoint Platform for your API fragment.

See xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[].

You cannot change the selected business group after creating the API fragment.
|===
. Click *Create Project*.
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the folder.
+
When the project is ready for editing, the API fragment project opens in the Explorer view.
For example, this OAS 3.0 (YAML) API fragment:
+
image:des-api-fragment-new.png["API Fragment tab on the Design an API page"]
. Continue designing your API fragment. 
+
As you enter elements, use xref:start-discover-ui.adoc#use-autocomplete[auto-complete] (Ctrl+Space) to display available options within the context.
+
If you created an OAS 3.0 (YAML) fragment project, you can replace the initial API fragment with the <<example-oas-api-frag,example>> code to test adding fragments to a spec.

. xref:des-sync-with-design-center.adoc[Sync your fragment with Design Center].
. xref:des-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[Publish your fragment to Exchange].
+
The status bar shows the progress.
When complete, you see a message that the API fragment successfully published to Exchange.
. Navigate to Anypoint Platform and log in using your credentials.
+
--
// Pointer to Platform URLs
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="platform-urls"]
--
. Navigate to Exchange.
+
--
// Pointer to Exchange URLs
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="exchange-urls"]
--
+
Your API specification appears as an API spec fragment type asset in your organization, for example:
+
image::des-api-frag-exchange.png["API Spec Fragment in Exchange"]
+
--
If your API specification appears on Exchange as a REST API rather than an API spec fragment, check that the `classifier` attribute in the `exchange.json` file in the project folder in your IDE is set to one of the following, depending on the language:

** OAS: `oas-components`
** RAML: `raml-fragment`
** JSON Schema: `json-schema`
--
+
--
If it's set to one of the following, the project is an API spec rather than a fragment:

** OAS: `oas`
** RAML: `raml`
--

[[add-fragment-to-project]]
== Add a Fragment from Exchange to Your Project

To add an API spec fragment from Exchange to the project directory so that you can include the fragment in your spec:

. Open your API spec project file, for example, <<example-oas-api-spec,`example-oas-spec`>>.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Enter `mulesoft` and select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Add Fragment dependency from Exchange
----
. If prompted, log in to Anypoint Platform.
. In the *Search for Asset* field, provide the name of the data type asset to add.
+
To search for assets, type the search term and press Enter, for example:
+
image::des-add-frag-from-exchange.png["Search for fragment in Assets from Exchange dropdown"]
. Select the fragment from the *Assets From Exchange* menu.
. Select a version of the fragment.
+
The status bar shows the progress. When complete, you see a message that the selected API fragment was successfully added to the project.
. Verify that the fragment dependency was added by checking the `dependencies` section of the `exchange.json` file, for example:
+
image::des-verify-frag-from-exchange.png["Verify the fragment dependency in the exchange.json file"]
+
You can also see the fragment in the Explorer view under Project Dependencies, for example:
+
image::des-api-frag-dependencies.png["API fragment in the Explorer view"]
+
The fragment files are located in your home directory on your system in the `.exchange_modules` directory, for example, `~/.exchange_modules` (Mac).


[[add-fragments-to-spec]]
== Add an API Fragment to Your API Spec

To add an API spec fragment to a spec:

. Open your API spec project file, for example, <<example-oas-api-spec,`example-oas-spec`>>.
. Place the cursor where you want to add the fragment.
. Depending on the API spec language, select the directive to add the fragment to your specification.
+
--
** OAS specs: Use the `$ref` directive.
** RAML specs: Use the `!include` directive.
--
+

[[create-add-fragment-directly]]
== Create and Add a Fragment Directly in Your Spec


To create a fragment in your project and include it in your specification:

. Open your API spec project file, for example, <<example-oas-api-spec,`example-oas-spec`>>.
. In the Explorer view, right-click on an empty space, and create a folder for your fragments, such as `fragments`.
. In the `fragments` folder, create a new file, such as `my-fragment` and add your fragment code.
. Place the cursor where you want to add the fragment.
. Depending on the API spec language, select the directive to add the fragment from the folder to your spec:
+
--
* OAS specs: Use the `$ref` directive.
* RAML specs: Use the `!include` directive.
--
+ 
[tabs]
====
OAS Example::
+
This `$ref` directive adds the `api_key` object from the `my-fragment.yaml` file:
+
[source,YAML]
--
api-key:
    $ref: fragments/my-fragment.yaml#/components/securitySchemes/api_key
--

RAML Example::
