Use the built-in integrated source control management (SCM) to sync American Flights API with Anypoint Design Center (Design Center). The Design Center SCM is built on Git.

== Before You Begin

If you haven't started the American Flight API specification, complete these procedures before attempting to synchronize:

. xref:tut-af-design-am-flights-api.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-test-specification.adoc[]

== Review Changes in Files

Identify changes to files in your API project since the last synchronization with the main branch in Design Center. When you change your API project, the *Source Control* icon in the Activity Bar identifies the number of changes to the API project. 

// TODO duke: hamburger menu present; maybe ok since it's fairly inobtrusive
image::changes-and-staged-changes.png["Changes and Staged Changes highlighted in the Source Control section"]

To review changes to your API project:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the *Source Control* menu by pressing Ctrl+Shift+g (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+g (Windows).
+
Alternatively, click the *Source Control* icon in the activity bar.
. Open your `exchange.json` file.
. Review the working tree and notice the shading for deletions (red) and additions (green).
+
// removed (hn) TODO duke: hamburger menu present; maybe ok if fairly inobtrusive

+
This example adds some dependencies to the API specification by reusing the API fragments downloaded from Anypoint Exchange.
. Proceed to <<stage>>.

[[stage]]
== Stage Changes to the Built-in SCM

Stage changes from one or more files from the UI or through the command line, with a Git command. The UI uses the `git add` command to add changes from your working directory to the staging area. This area includes updates for the next commit.

* <<stage-one>>
* <<stage-multiple>>

[[stage-one]]
=== Stage Changes to a Single File

To stage individual changes through the UI:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. Select the plus icon beside your specification file, such as `american-flight-api.raml` or `american-flight-api.yaml`.
+
The file moves to *Staged Changes* section.
. Review the changes in the Source Control section.
. Proceed to <<stage-multiple>> to stage changes to more than one file in your API project.

[[stage-multiple]]
=== Stage Changes to Multiple Files

Stage multiple files at the same time:

. Select your Source Control view for your API project.
. Click the plus icon in the *Changes* header to stage your remaining changes.
+
image::stage-all-changes.png["Plus icon highlighted to stage all changes"]
. Proceed to <<commit>>.

[[commit]]
== Commit Changes

The UI uses the `git commit` command to save the changes you staged to your local repository. 

To commit staged changes:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. In the message field, summarize your changes, and click *Commit*.
+
image::add-commit-message.png["Message box highlighted"]
. Your Source Control view now displays no changes to commit.
. Proceed to <<push>>.

[[push]]
== Push Changes to Anypoint Design Center

Use the `git push` command from the UI to upload your local content to Design Center.

To push your changes:

. Open the Source Control view.
. In the *Source Control* header, click the More actions menu (ellipsis).
. Select *Push*.
+
// removed (hn) TODO duke: hamburger in screenshot; does Sync Changes appear?
// hn: Sync Changes appears in both web and desktop
image::push-changes.png["Push command highlighted in the source control section"]
+
Your changes are now published in Design Center.
+
If the UI prompts you to `periodically run 'git fetch'`, indicate whether to check for updates of your API in Design Center and prompt you to update your local version of the API.
+

. Proceed to xref:tut-af-design-api-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[] so that your team can find and implement the specification.
