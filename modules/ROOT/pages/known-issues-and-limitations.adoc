The following list details identified issues and limitations with Anypoint Code Builder:

== General Limitations

[%header,cols="2a,2a,1a"]
|===
| Limitation | Workaround |ID
| Anypoint Code Builder does not decode Unicode characters for new lines in XML (`&#10;`) causing DataWeave validations to throw *Invalid input* errors on some multi-line scripts. This limitation does not interrupt the correct execution of your Mule application. | None | W-11750473
| Dark Theme not showing the error response. Due to an issue with the color scheme of API Console, when using Anypoint Code Builder in dark mode, the error messages in the console are hard to read. | None | W-11351113
| Redeployment to CloudHub is not supported. | Delete and deploy the application again. |
| When launching the web IDE for the first time from Anypoint Code Builder central page, you must allow popups from the page. | None. |
| You can't import and scaffold older version of REST API assets from Exchange. | None. | W-12406413
| Code highlighting breaks when you define a DataWeave multiline expression. This limitation does not interrupt the correct execution of your Mule application. | None. | W-11492623
| The RAML editor does not handle indentation correctly when using tabs or spaces. | None. | W-11625929
