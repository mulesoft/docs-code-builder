Use Anypoint Code Builder to build integrations within a Mule application.
Integrations with Anypoint Code Builder rely on a service-based framework that decouples your source from protocols and routing requirements.
You can reuse or change operations and processors in the application when your systems or business needs change. 

Integrations enable multiple services to work as one.
Some common use cases are:

* Scheduling data processing
* Connecting cloud and on-premises applications
* Transforming message data to a required structure or format
* Event processing in which multiple services are composed and operate simultaneously

After you xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[create your integration project],
you can optionally:
