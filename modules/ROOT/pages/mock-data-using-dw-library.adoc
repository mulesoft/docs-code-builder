The following tutorial shows you how to develop an integration, import the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/data-weave-mock-data-generators-library/minor/1.0/[Mock Data Generators Library^] from Exchange, and use  the custom library to return a random value from the library.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[Setup] for more information.

== Create a Mule Application

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+shift+p (Windows), and type `MuleSoft: Develop an Integration`.
+
. Select the command.
+
// . In your cloud IDE instance, navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view:
// . Select *Develop an Integration*.
. Configure your integration using the following values:
+
image::integration-create-ui.png[]
+
[calloutlist]
.. For *Project Name*, type `mock-dw-library`.
.. For *Project Location*, click *Browse*, and then select your home directory.
. Click *Create Project*.

== Create a Flow

Start by configuring a flow with an HTTP listener that exposes a root path (`/`):

. Between the `<mule>` and `</mule>` elements, create an HTTP Listener global configuration:
+
[source,XML]
--
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
</http:listener-config>
--
. After the `</http:listener-config>` element, add a flow and an HTTP Listener element:
+
[source,XML]
--
<flow name="receive-request" doc:name="Flow" >
  <http:listener path="/" config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="bbzemf" />
</flow>
--

== Import the DataWeave Library

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange
----
+
// TODO: cc: I don't think we need this screenshot.
// image::import-asset-from-exchange-db.png[]
. Select *DataWeave Library*.
. Start typing _DataWeave_, and press Return to list assets that match your search.
. Select *DataWeave Mock Data Generators Library*.
. Select version *1.0.0*.

Anypoint Code Builder displays a message indicating that the dependency was successfully added.

== Use the DataWeave Library

. After the `<http:listener>` element, add a new line and create a Set Payload processor:
+
[source,XML]
--
<flow name="receive-request" doc:name="Flow" >
  <http:listener path="/" config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="bbzemf" />
  <set-payload value="#[]" doc:name="Set Payload" doc:id="ee6848" />
</flow>
--
. Add the following DataWeave script inside the `value` element of the `set-payload` element:
+
[source,dataweave]
--
%dw 2.0
output application/json
import * from mocks::DataGenerators
---


mocks::DataGenerators::randomCity()
--

Review your XML code:

[source,XML]
--
<flow name="receive-request" doc:name="Flow" >
  <http:listener path="/" config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="bbzemf" />
  <set-payload
    doc:name="Set Payload"
    value="#[%dw 2.0 output application/json import * from mocks::DataGenerators --- mocks::DataGenerators::randomCity()]"
    />
</flow>
--

== Import the HTTP Connector Library

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange
----
+
. Select *Connector*.
. Start typing _HTTP_, and press Return to list assets that match your search.
. Select *HTTP Connector - Mule 4*.
. Select the latest version.

Anypoint Code Builder displays a message indicating that the dependency was successfully added.

== Deploy the Application

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Deploy to CloudHub
----
. Anypoint Code Builder prompts that a deployment configuration file has been created and opens it for you to review:
+
[source,json]
--
{
  "runtime": "4.4.0",
  "workerSize": 0.1,
  "applicationName": "mock-dw-library", //<1>
  "workers": 1,
  "autoStart": true
}
--
[calloutlist]
.. The `applicationName` property defines the part of the URL that you use to access your application on CloudHub. +
The name must be unique across all applications deployed to CloudHub.
. After reviewing the deployment configuration, select *Deploy* to deploy the application to CloudHub.
. Select your preferred environment.
+
Anypoint Code Builder packages the application and deploys it to CloudHub.
. After deployment completes, select *Open in Runtime Manager*.
. Select your application from the application list. +
The domain name of the application varies, but it follows a similar structure such as: `+mock-dw-library.eu-s1.cloudhub.io+`.
. Open your preferred REST client and make a GET request to the domain name as displayed in *Runtime Manager*.
. Your application now returns a random city every time you reach the endpoint.
