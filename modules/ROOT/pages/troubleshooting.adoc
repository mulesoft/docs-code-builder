[[check-logs]]
== Check for Problems and Issues

When you don't know how to resolve an issue, the first step is to check for and review problems, console output, and logs. 

The *Output* panel provides build details and access to logs. The *Problems* tab lists warnings and error messages. Error messages and logs list underlying issues that can help you understand what went wrong and what requires attention. 

* To view project logs from the *Output* panel, see xref:start-open-panel.adoc[].
* To view problems, open the *Problems* tab by pressing Cmd+Shift+m (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+m (Windows). 

[[export-troubleshooting-info]]
== Export Troubleshooting Information

If the MuleSoft support team requests troubleshooting information about your project, export a compressed file that contains your project's workspace folders, logs, and information about environment variables, CPU, operating system, and system properties.

//step to open command palette:
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide this command:
+
[source, command]
----
MuleSoft: Export Troubleshooting Information
----
. When you receive a notification about the information that the command extracts, click *Continue*. 
+
When the process is complete, the IDE shows this message:
+
----
Collecting information...: Generating compressed file
----
. Click *Open folder* to locate the file. 
+
The command places the file in your home directory. The filename has the prefix `acb-troubleshooting`, for example, `/Users/me/acb-troubleshooting-w9ffppmq.tar.gz`.
. Provide a copy of the file to the support team. 

[[manage-cloud]]
== Manage Your Cloud IDE Instance

Manage your cloud IDE instance directly from the Anypoint Code Builder in Anypoint Platform.

image::web-ide-management-central-page.png["Cloud IDE management page"]

[calloutlist]
. *Version and IDE Details*: 
+
Shows the version of your Anypoint Code Builder cloud IDE instance. You can hover over *View IDE Details* to view some internal details about your cloud IDE instance:

* *Image*: The ID of the image of your cloud IDE instance.
* *URL*: The URL to directly access your cloud IDE instance. +
This URL is necessary to ping your locally deployed Mule application when debugging.
* *Created at*: Date and time of the creation of the cloud IDE instance.
. *Reboot*: Button for rebooting your cloud IDE instance.
. *Delete*: Button for deleting your cloud IDE instance.
+
[WARNING]
--
Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. The process removes all the projects hosted on the IDE instance.
--

[[check-extension-pack]]
== Check for Anypoint Extension Pack Installation

To determine whether Anypoint Code Builder extensions are installed in the desktop IDE, check for the *Anypoint Extension Pack* in the *Extensions: Marketplace* panel of the IDE:

. In the Activity Bar, click the Extensions icon to open the *Extensions: Marketplace* panel.
+
To find this icon, see xref:start-discover-ui.adoc[].
. In the panel's search field, type _Anypoint_ to locate *Anypoint Extension Pack* in the list of installed extensions.

* If the extension pack is _not_ installed, follow the installation steps at xref:start-acb.adoc#set-up-desktop[Set up the Desktop IDE].
* If the extension pack is installed but the MuleSoft icon is not present in the Activity Bar, see xref:troubleshoot-missing-features.adoc#missing-mulesoft-icon[MuleSoft Icon Missing from Activity Bar] to display the icon.

[[folder-permission]]
== Folder Permission Error

Some high-level folders in the Cloud IDE are protected and not available for your projects. Examples include `/home`, `/`, and `.config`. Attempts to create an integration, implementation, or design project in a protected folder produces the following error:

----
EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/home/XXXX/.vscode'
----

To avoid this error, create and import your projects within your `/home/_your-user-name_/` folder or in a subdirectory that you create under this folder. The cloud IDE automatically provides the folder with your username.

Also avoid creating your projects under `/home/AnypointCodeBuilder`, which is intended for downloads of Mule and Java versions and for xref:ref-acb-maven.adoc#anypoint-code-builder-settings-file[acb_settings.xml].
