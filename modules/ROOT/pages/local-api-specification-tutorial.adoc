Scaffold an API specification into an interface project within your IDE, and synchronize changes to the specification with the interface without first publishing to Anypoint Exchange. For example, after adding a new endpoint to your API specification, you can re-scaffold the change into the interface to add a flow for that endpoint to the interface's configuration XML file.

The interface XML is automatically created in a Mule project during the scaffolding process. You define an API in a specification file within an API Design project.

Iterative API design and implementation within the IDE takes place in a _multi-root workspace_ in VS Code. To map project folders for your API specification and implementation projects into a multi-root workspace, VS Code uses a file with the extension `.code-workspace`. For your projects to work properly, this file _must not reside within_ either project folder. In addition, Anypoint Code Builder permits only one pair of iterative design and implementation project folders per multi-root workspace. The procedures for creating the specification and implementation projects are designed to meet these requirements. For information in the VS Code documentation, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[Multi-root Workspaces^].

NOTE: The procedures are currently written for the desktop IDE only.

== Before You Begin

Follow procedures in xref:setup.adoc[Set Up and Access Anypoint Code Builder].

[[create]]
== Create an API Specification

. In the desktop IDE, open a new window in VS Code by pressing Cmd+Shift+n (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+n (Windows).
+
This step helps prevent the possibility of creating an API specification in a multi-root workspace that already contains iterative design and implementation projects and ensures that the command required in the next procedure, <<scaffold>>, is available.
. Open Anypoint Code Builder by clicking the *Anypoint Code Builder* (MuleSoft) icon in the activity bar. 
. Start an API specification by clicking the quick action *Design an API*. 
+
Alternatively, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Design an API
----
. If prompted, sign in to Anypoint Platform, and follow all the prompts to reopen the IDE. 
. Start your API specification:
+
image::design-api-ui-first.png["Configure Retrieve Users API"]
+
--
[calloutlist]
.. In *Project name*, type: 
+
*Retrieve Users API*
+
The name must be unique.
.. In *Project Location*, click *Browse*. 
+
In the file menu that opens in the desktop IDE, create a folder such as `workspace-retrieve-users`, and then select that folder's location. 
+
When you are done, the full path in the *Project Location* field is similar to `/Users/me/workspace-retrieve-users`. Starting from the directory with your new folder prevents potential issues related to multi-root workspaces.
.. In *API Specification Language*, select *RAML 1.0*.
.. In *Business Group*, select the business group for your API specification. You can't change business groups after you create your API specification.
+
See xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[Business Groups] for more information. 
--
When complete, *Design an API* is similar to this example:
+
image::tut-api-create.png["Design an API configuration"]
. Select *Create Project*.
+
This process creates a project that contains your API specification within your workspace.
. Open your API specification file, `retrieve-users-api.raml`. 
. To track the progress of internal processing, open the *Output* panel to the *Mule DX Server*.
+
To open the panel from the command line:

.. Press Cmd+Shift+u (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) to open the Output panel.
.. Select *Mule DX Server* from the drop-down menu in the panel.
+
For more guidance, see xref:configure-default-output-panel.adoc[].

. In the editor for your API specification, add this example to `retrieve-users-api.raml`:
+

              } }]

. Proceed to <<scaffold>>.

[[scaffold]]
== Scaffold the Local API Specification into an Interface

Scaffold your local API specification into a local implementation project. The scaffolding process creates a configuration XML for your implementation. 

Local projects reside in the Anypoint Code Builder IDE, whether the projects are in your desktop IDE or in the web IDE associated with your user account in Anypoint Platform. 

Scaffold your local API specification:

. With `retrieve-users-api.raml` open in your IDE, prepare to scaffold the specification into a Mule project:
 
.. Find and click the X-shaped *Implement this local API* icon for the specification file. 
+
[[icon-implement-this-api]]
image::tut-local-spec-implement.png["UI with the X-shaped icon for the command Implement this Local API"]
+
Alternatively, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement this Local API
----
+
_Do not select_ the command `MuleSoft: Implement an API Specification`, which is for implementing a specification that is published on Anypoint Exchange and _not for_ implementing a local API specification. 

.. Click *OK* when the UI displays the message *We'll create a workspace to keep your API specification and Mule project in sync.*
+
The UI asks you to save a file with the extension `.code-workspace` for a multi-root workspace. 
+
IMPORTANT::
_Do not save this file within your API specification project folder_. Proceed to the next step, instead.
.. Navigate up to the parent folder you created for your workspace, and save the `.code-workspace` file.
.. Make sure that your *Mule DX Server* output is available for tracking the progress of internal processes in the *Output* panel.
+
The UI also provides a message *Implementing local API implementation, please wait.* 
+
As you monitor output, wait for the field with text `_Mule project name_` to appear at the top of the UI. For example:
+
image::tut-api-create-project.png["Provide name of scaffolded implementation project"]
. Start the scaffolding process by entering a name for your Mule implementation project, such as `retrieve-users-implementation`.
+
image::tut-api-create-project-retrieve-users.png["Provide name of scaffolded implementation project"]
. When prompted, click  *Select target folder*. 
+
The target folder is the project folder where you created your API specification.
+
The UI provides updates while the scaffolding process takes place:

* *Executing scaffolding operation, please wait*
* *Scaffolding process ended. You can now start iterating over your local API and implementation project*
. From your multi-root workspace in the Explorer, the IDE opens the scaffolded specification in your new Mule project. 
+
The configuration XML file for the implementation (`retrieve-users-implementation.xml`) is located in an implementation project directory similar to this one:
+
[source,implementation project directory]
----
retrieve-users-implementation/src/main/mule/retrieve-users-implementation.xml
----
* The UI canvas for this Mule project contains a Router component and several error handlers. APIkit automatically creates these components during the scaffolding process.
* In the implementation XML, the flow `<flow name="get:\users:retrieve-users-api-config">` contains an `<ee:transform/>` element with your example:
+

[[update-api-spec]]
== Update the API Specification and Re-scaffold the Implementation XML

Add an endpoint to your specification file and re-scaffold:

. In the Explorer, navigate to the specification file `retrieve-users-api.raml` in the *Retrieve Users API* directory.
. Append this `/userbyid` endpoint configuration to your RAML file:

. Proceed to <<save-spec>>.

[[save-spec]]
== Save your API Specification in Design Center

After implementing your API specification, save the specification to Design Center:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select the *Source Control* view of the IDE:

* In the desktop IDE, navigate to *View* > *Source Control*.
* In the web IDE, navigate to file menu > *View* > *Source Control*.
//TODO: bug? doesn't seem to work despite UI: 
//* In either IDE, press ^+Shift+g (Mac) or ^+Shift+g (Windows).
. Locate the API specification project for `retrieve-users-api.raml`.
. In the *Source Control* view, stage your changes by mousing over the *Changes* heading to expose the *+* (plus) icon and then clicking the icon.
+
image::tut-api-stage-changes.png["Stage API changes"]
. Type a commit message that summarizes the changes. For example: `_Retrieve Users Projects_`
+
This step avoids the need to specify a commit message through a separate file that pops up in the IDE.
. Click *Commit* for the staged changes, and wait for the commit process to complete. 
//TODO: check is Push is still there
. If prompted, click *Sync Changes* or *Push*. 
+
Your changes are now stored in the Design Center SCM.
. Proceed to <<publish>>.

[[publish]]
== Publish the API Specification to Exchange

After committing your changes to Design Center, publish the API specification to Anypoint Exchange to make the specification discoverable by your team members.

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange
----
. Type a project name: *Retrieve Users API*
+
image::tut-api-publish.png["Publish Retrieve Users API"]

. Confirm the artifact ID: *Retrieve-Users-API*
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
+
The status bar provides progress-related messages before the IDE updates your Mule project POM file to point to `v1.0.0` of your API specification: 

.. *Publishing API Specification to Exchange* 
.. Project *has been successfully published to Exchange*

The specification is now available on https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?show=org&sort=last[Anypoint Exchange^] for team members in your business group to scaffold into their projects and implement. See <<scaffold-from-exchange>>.

[[scaffold-from-exchange]]
== Scaffold the API Specification from Exchange

Team members in your business group can import your scaffolded API specification from Exchange:

. Open a new VS Code instance. 
. Import version 1.0.0 of your API from Design Center:
.. Enter this command:
+
----
MuleSoft: Implement an API Specification
----
.. In the *Implement an API Specification* tab that opens: 

* Provide a new name for the implementation.
* Select or create a new project location.
* Find your API specification on Anypoint Exchange, and click *Add* to insert the API name into the field. 
.. Click *Create Project* to start scaffolding the specification into a new implementation.  
. Implement the scaffolded specification in your IDE.

////
//TODO: ON HOLD. RETEST THIS PROCEDURE. CREATE STORY. FIX ANY ISSUES.
[[display-command]]
== Display the Command MuleSoft: Implement this Local API

If `MuleSoft: Implement this Local API Command` does not appear in the command palette from your open API specification project, potential causes are: 

* Another project in your multi-root workspace is implementing a local API specification. 
* The API specification is already has a snapshot version. 
+
The `exchange.json` file in the specification project should not have the `-SNAPSHOT` postfix.

To remove your project from a multi-root workspace:

. In the Explorer, right-click your new API specification folder, select *Remove project from workspace*.
. Open a new VS Code window by pressing Ctrl+Shift+n (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+n (Windows).
. In the new window, navigate to the API specification, and open the specification file:
.. Press Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder
----
.. Navigate to the root directory of the folder that contains your API specification. 
.. In the Explorer, click the filename for the specification, `retrieve-users-api.raml`.
. Wait for the <<icon-implement-this-api, X-shaped icon>> for the `MuleSoft: Implement this API` command to appear in the UI. 
+
To monitor the status of this process, open the *Output* panel with Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+u (Mac) and select *MS DX Server* from its drop-down menu. 
. Proceed to <<scaffold>> to start the implementation process.
////

== Close a Multi-root Workspace

Close a multi-root workspace with the command `Workspaces: Close Workspace`. 

After closing, you can reopen a synchronized project from the workspace that you create when implementing the API.

== Open a Multi-root Workspace

Open a multi-root workspace from the `.code-workspace` file, such as `Retrieve Users API.code-workspace`, for the projects in the workspace. 

. Open VS Code.
. Press Cmd+Shift+p (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Workspace from File...
----
. Navigate to and double-click the `.code-workspace` file for projects in the workspace.
+
The projects open in the Explorer view, and the heading for the multi-root-workspace appends a *(WORKSPACE)* identifier. For example:
+
image::tut-api-multiroot-workspace.png["A multi-root workspace in the Explorer"]
