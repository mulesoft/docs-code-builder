A Mule application is an integration or implementation application that runs on Mule runtime engine. To share the application across different teams, or to deploy the application elsewhere, you can export and package a snapshot of Mule application resources. Additionally, you can publish a Mule project to Exchange as either a template or an example.

* A <<shareable, shareable JAR file>> is lightweight, packaging only the source code of the application.
The source code includes configuration files but not libraries or other dependencies required for your application to run and deploy successfully.
+
The IDEs generate the dependencies automatically based on the settings in the POM file (`pom.xml`). 
+
You or your teammates can import the JAR file and continue developing in Anypoint Code Builder or Anypoint Studio (Studio).

* A <<deployable, deployable JAR file>> contains the compiled code and all dependencies.
+
You can deploy the JAR file to any supported environment, such as CloudHub or on-premises.
+
To deploy a JAR file to CloudHub, see
xref:cloudhub::deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[].
+
You don't need to create a deployable JAR file to deploy to CloudHub.
To deploy an app directly from Anypoint Code Builder, see
xref:int-deploy-mule-apps.adoc[].

* A <<publishable, publishable Mule project template or example>> contains resources to share the project via Anypoint Exchange.
+
You or your teammates can import the Mule project from Exchange and continue developing in Anypoint Code Builder or Anypoint Studio (Studio).

[[shareable]]
== Export to a Shareable JAR File

When you export a Mule project, the shareable JAR file includes these files:

* The configuration XML and other files in the `src` folder, including resource files
* `mule-artifact.json`
* `pom.xml`

To generate a shareable JAR file:

. Open and place your cursor in the configuration XML file in a project for the Mule application to export.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Export Mule Application Sources
----
+
This command is equivalent to the command sequence `Task: Run Task` > `mule` > `mule: Package Only Sources`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE opens automatically to provide the status of the packaging process, which includes execution of the export command, a scan for the project to export, and the packaging of the project snapshot into a JAR file.
. Find or download the JAR file by following the prompts that appear in the IDE after the packaging process completes successfully:
+
** In the desktop IDE, click *Open Folder* to open the directory that contains the JAR file in the Explorer view.
// +
// The file name for the JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-mule-application-light-package.jar`, for example, `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-mule-application-light-package.jar`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE also provides the path to the JAR, in the `/target` directory under your project folder.
In the desktop IDE, you can find the JAR file in the Explorer view, in the `target` folder and also under Java Projects:
+
image::int-export-shareable.png["Shareable JAR file in the Java Projects folder"]
+
** *In the cloud IDE*, click *Download File* to download the JAR file to a directory on your local machine:
+
--
** For a JAR file that is 32 MB or smaller, the IDE automatically downloads the file to your Downloads folder. 
** For a JAR file that is larger than 32 MB, the IDE disallows downloads to built-in folders that contain system files, such as the Downloads, Desktop, or Documents folder.
+
... Select a folder for the download.
... At the prompt, click *View files* to allow the site to view the files in the folder you select.
... Click *Save Changes*.
--
// +
// The file name for the downloaded shareable JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-shareable-mule-application.jar`, for example, `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-shareable-mule-application.jar`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE also provides the path to the JAR, in the `/target` directory under your project folder.
// but good luck finding it!

The file name for the downloaded shareable JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-mule-application-light-package.jar`, for example, `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-mule-application-light-package.jar`.

To open a shareable JAR file in a project workspace within Anypoint Code Builder, see xref:int-import-mule-project.adoc#desktop-project-package[Import a Shareable Project JAR File into the Desktop IDE] and xref:int-import-mule-project.adoc#web-project-package[Import a Shareable Project JAR File into the Cloud IDE].
// To import to Anypoint Studio, see xref:studio::import-export-packages.adoc[].


[[deployable]]
== Export to a Deployable JAR File

When you export a Mule project, Anypoint Code Builder packages the compiled code and all dependencies into a distributable JAR.

Deployment procedures vary by Mule runtime host and deployment mechanism.
For example, you can deploy to CloudHub through the Runtime Manager UI or REST API.
For more information, see xref:hosting-home::index.adoc#runtime-plane-hosting-options.adoc[Runtime Plane Hosting Options] and xref:4.4@mule-runtime::deploying.adoc[Deploy Mule Applications]. 

To generate a deployable JAR file:

. Open and place your cursor in the configuration XML file in a project for the Mule application to export.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Export Project to Mule Deployable Jar
----
+
This command is equivalent to the command sequence `Task: Run Task` > `mule` > `mule: Package`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE opens automatically to provide the status of the packaging process, which includes the execution of the export command, a scan for the project to export, and the packaging of the project snapshot into a JAR file.
+
. Find or download the JAR file by following the prompts that appear in the IDE after the packaging process completes successfully:
+
** *In the desktop IDE*, click *Open Folder* to open the directory that contains the JAR file in the Explorer view.
// +
// The file name for the JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-mule-application.jar`, for example: `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-mule-application.jar`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE also provides the path to the JAR, in the `/target` directory under your project folder.
In the Desktop IDE, you can find the JAR file in the Explorer, under Java Projects:
+
image::int-export-deployable.png["Deployable JAR file in the Java Projects folder"]

* *In the cloud IDE*, click *Download File* to download the JAR file to a directory on your local machine.
+
--
** For a JAR file that is 32 MB or smaller, the IDE automatically downloads the file to your Downloads folder. 
** For a JAR file that is larger than 32 MB, the IDE disallows downloads to built-in folders that contain system files, such as the Downloads, Desktop, or Documents folder.
+
... Select a folder for the download.
... At the prompt, click *View files* to allow the site to view the files in the folder you select.
... Click *Save Changes*.
--

The file name for the downloaded deployable JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-mule-application.jar`, for example: `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-mule-application.jar`.

[[publishable]]
== Publish a Mule Project to Exchange as a Template or Example

A _project template_ is a pre-configured, reusable project setup that serves as a starting point for developing Mule applications. These templates are designed to provide a structured framework that includes common configurations, example code, and best practices.

A _project example_ is a sample application that demonstrates specific functionalities or use cases. These examples are designed to provide practical, real-world scenarios to help developers understand how to implement various features and integrations.

// Templates are packaged integration patterns built on best practices to address common use cases. Examples are applications that are ready to run and demonstrate a use case or solution.

To publish a Mule Project to Exchange as either a template or an example:

. Open and place your cursor in the configuration XML file in a project for the Mule project to publish.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish Project to Exchange
----

. Either select your Anypoint Platform user and business group or create a new Anypoint Platform account by clicking *Add Account*.
Additionally, you can click the *Add Account* button to use a new Anypoint Platform account.
. Verify that the required identification and version information for your project is present and correct:
+
image::configure-asset-properties.png["A form to publish a project to Exchange, with fields for user information, project details, and project type"]

[calloutlist]
. *Name*: The name of your API specification.
. *Description*: (optional) A description of your API specification.
. *Group ID*: The organization ID of your Anypoint Platform organization.
. *Artifact ID*: The name of your project, minus its version. By default, Studio uses the artifact ID configured in your `pom.xml` file.
. *Version*: The version of the asset you are publishing.
. *Project type*: If you are publishing a new version of an already published asset, you cannot change the project type.

[start=6]
. Select *Next*.
. Configure the tags, categories, and custom fields for your project:
+
image::tags-and-categories-configuration.png["A window with options to add tags, categories, and custom fields"]
+
Categories cannot be created from Anypoint Code Builder directly. Refer to the xref:exchange::to-manage-categories.adoc[Manage Categories] documentation to learn how to create Categories for your organization.
+
Custom fields cannot be created from Anypoint Code Builder directly. Refer to the xref:exchange::to-manage-custom-fields.adoc[Manage Custom Fields] documentation to learn how to create custom fields for your organization.
+
. Check the *Save updated project information to the pom.xml* box to update your `pom.xml` file with the data provided. This option syncs your local project information with the data you entered. If not checked, your project is deployed with the provided data, but your local project remains with the original information and is not updated.
. Select *Finish*.

Once you select *Finish*, the publication of your project as a new asset in Exchange begins. You can follow the progress of this publication process in the Console view, but you cannot cancel it.
