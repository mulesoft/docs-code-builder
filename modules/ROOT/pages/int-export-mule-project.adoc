A Mule application is an integration or implementation application that runs on Mule runtime engine. To share the application across different teams, or to deploy the application elsewhere, you can export and package a snapshot of Mule application resources. Additionally, you can publish a Mule project to Exchange as either a template or an example.

* A <<shareable, shareable JAR file>> is lightweight, packaging only the source code of the application.
The source code includes configuration files but not libraries or other dependencies required for your application to run and deploy successfully.
+
The IDEs generate the dependencies automatically based on the settings in the POM file (`pom.xml`). 
+
You or your teammates can import the JAR file and continue developing in Anypoint Code Builder or Anypoint Studio (Studio).

* A <<deployable, deployable JAR file>> contains the compiled code and all dependencies.
+
You can deploy the JAR file to any supported environment, such as CloudHub or on-premises.
+
To deploy a JAR file to CloudHub, see
xref:cloudhub::deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[].
+
You don't need to create a deployable JAR file to deploy to CloudHub.
To deploy an app directly from Anypoint Code Builder, see
xref:int-deploy-mule-apps.adoc[].

* A <<publishable, publishable Mule project template or example>> contains resources to share the project via Anypoint Exchange.
+
You or your teammates can import the Mule project from Exchange and continue developing in Anypoint Code Builder or Studio.

[[shareable]]
== Export to a Shareable JAR File

When you export a Mule project, the shareable JAR file includes these files:

* The configuration XML and other files in the `src` folder, including resource files
* `mule-artifact.json`
* `pom.xml`

To generate a shareable JAR file:

. Open and place your cursor in the configuration XML file in a project for the Mule application to export.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Export Mule Application Sources
----
+
This command is equivalent to the command sequence `Task: Run Task` > `mule` > `mule: Package Only Sources`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE opens automatically to provide the status of the packaging process, which includes execution of the export command, a scan for the project to export, and the packaging of the project snapshot into a JAR file.
. Find or download the JAR file by following the prompts that appear in the IDE after the packaging process completes successfully:
+
** In the desktop IDE, click *Open Folder* to open the directory that contains the JAR file in the Explorer view.
// +
// The file name for the JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-mule-application-light-package.jar`, for example, `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-mule-application-light-package.jar`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE also provides the path to the JAR, in the `/target` directory under your project folder.
In the desktop IDE, you can find the JAR file in the Explorer view, in the `target` folder and also under Java Projects:
+
image::int-export-shareable.png["Shareable JAR file in the Java Projects folder"]
+
** *In the cloud IDE*, click *Download File* to download the JAR file to a directory on your local machine:
+
--
** For a JAR file that is 32 MB or smaller, the IDE automatically downloads the file to your Downloads folder. 
** For a JAR file that is larger than 32 MB, the IDE disallows downloads to built-in folders that contain system files, such as the Downloads, Desktop, or Documents folder.
+
... Select a folder for the download.
... At the prompt, click *View files* to allow the site to view the files in the folder you select.
... Click *Save Changes*.
--
// +
// The file name for the downloaded shareable JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-shareable-mule-application.jar`, for example, `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-shareable-mule-application.jar`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE also provides the path to the JAR, in the `/target` directory under your project folder.
// but good luck finding it!

The file name for the downloaded shareable JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-mule-application-light-package.jar`, for example, `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-mule-application-light-package.jar`.

To open a shareable JAR file in a project workspace within Anypoint Code Builder, see xref:int-import-mule-project.adoc#desktop-project-package[Import a Shareable Project JAR File into the Desktop IDE] and xref:int-import-mule-project.adoc#web-project-package[Import a Shareable Project JAR File into the Cloud IDE].
// To import to Anypoint Studio, see xref:studio::import-export-packages.adoc[].


[[deployable]]
== Export to a Deployable JAR File

When you export a Mule project, Anypoint Code Builder packages the compiled code and all dependencies into a distributable JAR.

Deployment procedures vary by Mule runtime host and deployment mechanism.
For example, you can deploy to CloudHub through the Runtime Manager UI or REST API.
For more information, see xref:hosting-home::index.adoc#runtime-plane-hosting-options.adoc[Runtime Plane Hosting Options] and xref:4.4@mule-runtime::deploying.adoc[Deploy Mule Applications]. 

To generate a deployable JAR file:

. Open and place your cursor in the configuration XML file in a project for the Mule application to export.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Export Project to Mule Deployable Jar
----
+
This command is equivalent to the command sequence `Task: Run Task` > `mule` > `mule: Package`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE opens automatically to provide the status of the packaging process, which includes the execution of the export command, a scan for the project to export, and the packaging of the project snapshot into a JAR file.
+
. Find or download the JAR file by following the prompts that appear in the IDE after the packaging process completes successfully:
+
** *In the desktop IDE*, click *Open Folder* to open the directory that contains the JAR file in the Explorer view.
// +
// The file name for the JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-mule-application.jar`, for example: `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-mule-application.jar`.
+
The terminal window in the IDE also provides the path to the JAR, in the `/target` directory under your project folder.
In the Desktop IDE, you can find the JAR file in the Explorer, under Java Projects:
+
image::int-export-deployable.png["Deployable JAR file in the Java Projects folder"]

* *In the cloud IDE*, click *Download File* to download the JAR file to a directory on your local machine.
+
--
** For a JAR file that is 32 MB or smaller, the IDE automatically downloads the file to your Downloads folder. 
** For a JAR file that is larger than 32 MB, the IDE disallows downloads to built-in folders that contain system files, such as the Downloads, Desktop, or Documents folder.
+
... Select a folder for the download.
... At the prompt, click *View files* to allow the site to view the files in the folder you select.
... Click *Save Changes*.
--

The file name for the downloaded deployable JAR file follows the pattern `_application_name_-_version_-SNAPSHOT-mule-application.jar`, for example: `my-app-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-mule-application.jar`.

[[publishable]]
== Publish a Mule Project to Exchange

You can publish a project as either a template or an example.

A _project template_ is a pre-configured, reusable project setup that serves as a starting point for developing Mule applications. These templates provide a structured framework that includes common configurations, example code, and best practices.

A _project example_ is a sample application that demonstrates specific functionalities or use cases. These examples provide practical, real-world scenarios to help developers implement various features and integrations.

To publish a Mule project to Exchange as either a template or an example:

. Open and place your cursor in the configuration XML file in a project for the Mule project to publish.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish Mule Project to Exchange
----

. Select an *Asset Type*.
+
Select either an *Example* or a *Template*.
. Ensure that the following fields contain the correct values for your asset:
+
image::publish-project-to-exchange-dialog.png["Form for publishing a project to Exchange",width=55%]
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"]
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Asset Name* | The name that Exchange uses to identify the published project.
| *Version* | The version number to be displayed in the *Version* section of the page that Exchange creates for the asset.

If you are publishing the asset for the first time, you can use any valid number. A typical starting version is `1.0.0`.

If you are republishing the asset, Anypoint Code Builder automatically populates the *Version* field. You can change this number, but the republish fails if you use a version number that has already been used to publish a stable version of this asset.

| *Description* | An optional description of your asset.
| *Business Group* | The business unit in Anypoint Platform to which the asset belongs.
| *Group ID* | The ID of the business unit in Anypoint Platform to which the asset belongs.
| *Artifact ID* | A unique ID that Exchange uses to identify the published asset. Use the default value unless there is a published asset with the same ID.
|===

. In *Advanced Options*, make sure that these fields contain the correct values for your asset:
+
image::publish-project-to-exchange-advanced-dialog.png["Form for publishing a project to Exchange",width=55%]
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"]
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Tags* | Descriptors that Exchange uses to search for assets.
| *Categories* | The category that was previously added to Exchange. Refer to the xref:exchange::to-manage-categories.adoc[Manage Categories] documentation to learn how to create Categories for your organization.
|===

. In *Advanced Options*, select the *Keep your local and published project in sync* checkbox to sync your local project information with the data you entered. If deselected, your project deploys with the provided data, but your local project doesn't include the updated information.
. Select *Publish*.

The publication of your project as a new asset begins. Once publication succeeds, select *View Asset* to view the asset in Exchange.
