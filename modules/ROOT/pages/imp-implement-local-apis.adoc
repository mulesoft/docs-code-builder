= Iteratively Design and Implement APIs
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 


Using Anypoint Code Builder, you can scaffold an API specification into a new integration project without first publishing the API to Anypoint Exchange.
As you make changes, you sync changes in the project by re-scaffolding the spec.
For example, after adding a new endpoint to your API spec,
you re-scaffold to add a new flow for that endpoint to the configuration XML file.


[IMPORTANT]
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="fragments-not-scaffolded"]


After syncing the API spec and related Mule project, you can modify the API specification and implement changes simultaneously.

By using this method to implement the API, you reflect your changes to your API design directly into the interface in your Mule project.
Iterating between API design and implementation tasks speeds up the development process.

When you're ready, publish your API specification to Exchange and deploy your Mule project.

When you scaffold your API specification into a new integration project,
Anypoint Code Builder creates a configuration XML for your implementation.


== Multi-Root Workspace Considerations

When you scaffold an API, Anypoint Code Builder creates a _multi-root workspace_ in VS Code 
with both the API spec and integration projects and keeps them synchronized.

VS Code uses a file with the extension `.code-workspace` to store your multi-root workspace.
This file maps the folders for your API spec and implementation projects.

[IMPORTANT]
For your projects to work properly, the `.code-workspace` file _must not reside_ within either project folder.

In addition, Anypoint Code Builder permits only one pair of iterative design and implementation project folders per multi-root workspace.

For more information, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[Multi-root Workspaces^] in the VS Code documentation.

== Scaffold an API Spec into a New Implementation Project

To scaffold the current API spec into a new implementation project:

. Click the image:icon-implement-api.png["",15,15] (*Implement this local API*) icon in the activity bar:
+
image::imp-local-api.png["Implement this local API icon in the activity bar"]
+
Alternatively, use the Command Palette.
+
.Show me how
[%collapsible]
====
. Open the Command Palette

** Use the keyboard shortcuts:
*** Mac: Cmd+Shift+p
*** Windows: Ctrl+Shift+p
** In the desktop IDE, select *View* > *Command Palette*. 
** In the cloud IDE, click the image:icon-menu.png["",18,18] (menu) icon, and select *View* > *Command Palette*.

. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
--
MuleSoft: Implement this Local API
--
====

. At the prompt, click *OK*:
+
image::imp-local-workspace-prompt.png["Prompt: *We'll create a workspace to keep your API specification and Mule project in sync.*"]
+
//TODO: VERIFY THE FOLLOWING: 
After the workspace is created, Anypoint Code Builder builds and packages the API specification, and publishes it to a local Maven repository as a snapshot.
. Navigate to a directory for your new project, and click *Save*.
+
Anypoint Code Builder starts creating a multi-root workspace with your API specification and Mule project. 
+
In the multi-root workspace, you can work with both your API specification and Mule project folders at the same time.
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
Do not accept the default location.

Save your `.code-workspace` file in a directory outside of your project folder, _not_ within your API spec folder.
--
. When prompted, provide project configuration details: 
.. Provide a name for your Mule project.
.. Navigate to a folder for your Mule project, and click *Select target folder*.  
.. Select a Mule runtime version for the project.
.. Select a Java version for the project.
+
Anypoint Code Builder scaffolds your local API specification into a new Mule project and displays a message when complete:
+
image::imp-local-api-scaffolded.png["Scaffolding process ended message"]
+
Both the API spec and the Mule project open in your IDE, for example:
+
image::imp-local-api-workspace.png["API spec and implementation project in Explorer view"]
+
--
[calloutlist]
.. API spec
.. Implementation project
--
. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your interface.
. Click the image:icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the canvas UI if it doesn't open automatically.
+
Notice that the new Mule project includes flows for each endpoint, a built-in XML-based router, and error handlers,
which you then implement within a Mule application.
+
You can switch between the spec and the implementation project in the Explorer view.


To close your multi-root workspace, see <<close-workspace>>. 


[[rescaffold-api-spec]]
== Re-Scaffold the API Spec

After making changes to your API spec, such as adding a new endpoint, re-scaffold the spec to update your Mule project:

. In the Explorer view, navigate to the API spec file.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Re-scaffold this local API
----
+
After you see the message that your project was rescaffolded successfully, navigate to your implementation XML file, and notice the new flow was added.

//TODO:
// ADD NOTE ABOUT caveats for rescaffolding AsyncAPI specs?

[[close-workspace]]
== Close a Multi-Root Workspace

To close the workspace:

// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
Workspaces: Close Workspace
----

After closing, you can reopen a synchronized project from the workspace that you created when implementing the API.
See <<open-workspace>>.

[[open-workspace]]
== Open a Multi-Root Workspace

To open a multi-root workspace from the `.code-workspace` file: 

// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Workspace from File...
----
. Navigate to your home directory and double-click the `.code-workspace` file for the workspace.
+
The projects open in the Explorer view, and the folder name for the multi-root workspace includes *(WORKSPACE)*, for example:
+
image::imp-local-api-open-workspace.png["A multi-root workspace in Explorer view"]
