Publish American Flights API specification to Exchange so that other team members can find and implement it.

== Before You Begin

If you haven't started the American Flight API specification, follow these procedures before attempting to publish:

. xref:tut-af-design-am-flights-api.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-test-specification.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-synchronize-with-design-center.adoc[]


== Publish an API to Exchange

To publish your API to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the specification for your American Flights API project, such as `american-flights-api.raml`.
. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange
----
+
// Fixed (hn) TODO: Cloud IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic. Plus, take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
// Fixed (hn) TODO duke: fix/redo image
image::publish-to-exchange.png["MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange highlighted in Command Palette"]
. Type a project name: *American Flights API*
image::set-asset-name.png["American Flights API option highlighted"]
. Confirm the artifact ID: *American-Flights-API*
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
The status bar shows the progress.

. When prompted to implement the API now, select *No* to avoid scaffolding the American Flights API specification into your integration.
For example:
+
image::scaffold-project-no.png["No option highlighted in the API implementation"]
+
Selecting *Yes* scaffolds the API specification into your project. Instead of scaffolding now, you will scaffold in xref:tut-af-implement-am-flights-api.adoc[].

== Locate Your API in Exchange

After publishing your API specification, you can find it in Anypoint Exchange:

. Navigate to Anypoint Platform and log in using your credentials.
. Navigate to Anypoint Exchange.
. Notice that your API specification is listed as an asset.
+
You can select the API, navigate through its summary, and see all the endpoints you defined in the previous tasks.
. Proceed to xref:tut-af-integrate-am-flights.adoc[] to start an integration app for American Flights.
