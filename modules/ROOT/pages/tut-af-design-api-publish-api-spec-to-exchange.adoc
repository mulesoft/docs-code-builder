Publish American Flights API specification to Exchange so that other team members can find and implement it.

== Before You Begin

If you haven't started the American Flight API specification, follow these procedures before attempting to publish:

. xref:tut-af-design-am-flights-api.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-test-specification.adoc[]

== Publish an API to Exchange

To publish your API to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the specification for your American Flights API project, such as `american-flights-api.raml`.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange
----
+
image::publish-to-exchange.png["MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange highlighted in Command Palette"]
. Type a project name: *American Flights API*.
//TODO: determine WHEN they add the business group in this sequence
//. Provide the *Business Group* with which this specification belongs.
//+
//For more information, see xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[].
//TODO: is this going to be hard for the user to determine? 
//How will they know what business groups are available to them?
. Confirm the artifact ID: *American-Flights-API*.
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
The status bar shows the progress:
+

. When prompted to implement the API now, select *No* to avoid scaffolding the American Flights API specification into your integration.
+
Selecting *Yes* scaffolds the API specification into your project. Instead of scaffolding now, you will scaffold in xref:tut-af-implement-am-flights-api.adoc[].

== Locate Your API in Exchange

After publishing your API specification, you can find it in Anypoint Exchange:

. Navigate to Anypoint Platform and log in using your credentials.
