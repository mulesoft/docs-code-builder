* If you haven't started the American Flight API specification, follow these procedures before attempting to publish:
+
. xref:tut-af-design-am-flights-api.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-design-api-test-specification.adoc[]

// Prereq bullet on familiarity with biz groups
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="prereq-business-groups"]


== Publish an API to Exchange

To publish your API to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the specification for your American Flights API project, such as `american-flights-api.raml`.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange
----
+
image::publish-to-exchange.png["MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange highlighted in Command Palette"]
. If prompted, click *Allow*, and follow the prompts to sign in to Anypoint Platform.
. In *Select a Business Group*, find and select your business group for the project. 
+
For more information, see <<prereqs>>.
. Type a project name: *American Flights API*.

. When prompted to implement the API now, select *No* to avoid scaffolding the American Flights API specification into your integration.
+
Selecting *Yes* scaffolds the API specification into your project. Instead of scaffolding now, you will scaffold in xref:tut-af-implement-am-flights-api.adoc[].
