Use Anypoint Code Builder to create an API specification example called American Flights API. In this API, reuse API fragments from Anypoint Exchange, create data types and response examples, test your API using API Console, and publish the API as an asset to Exchange.

After completing all API specification tasks, xref:tut-af-implement-am-flights-api.adoc[implement] the specification within an xref:tut-af-integrate-am-flights.adoc[integration]. For more information, see xref:tut-af-amflights-overview.adoc[].

[[prereqs]]
== Before You Begin

* Set up and access the web or desktop IDE.
+
See xref:start-acb.adoc[] for guidance.
* Have some familiarity with xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[business groups].
+
API specifications belong to a business group.

[[start-spec]]
== Start American Flights API

Start creating the American Flights API specification:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
+
image::acb-mulesoft-in-activity-bar.png["MuleSoft icon in the VS Code Activity Bar"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Design an API*:
+
image::design-api-1.png["Link to Design an API in the MuleSoft panel"]
+
If you receive the error *Mule DX API Component was not installed*, wait for Mule runtime to load and for background processes to complete. To monitor background processes, see xref:troubleshoot-loading-errors.adoc[].
. Configure your API specification project using these values:
+
[%header,cols="1a,1a"]
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | *American Flights API* +
                    Alternatively, provide a similar name of your choice. The name must be unique. The name of the project and specification file is based on the name you provide.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create (see xref:start-add-folders.adoc[]).
| *API Type* | *REST API* +
Anypoint Code Builder supports REST and AsyncAPI API types.
| *API Specification Language* | *RAML 1.0* +
                                  Anypoint Code Builder supports OAS and RAML. 
|===
. Select *Create Project* to generate the American Flights API project file: `american-flights-api.raml`.
+
The file name is based on the name you provide for the project:
+
image::acb-api-project.png["Project for American Airlines API"]
. Proceed to <<add-flight-resource>>.

[[add-flight-resource]]
== Add a RAML Resource and Methods

In American Flights API, start configuring the specification, and try its *GET* method from the API Console. 

//TODO: CREATE AN INCLUDE FOR THIS COMMON STEP (make description more generic for multiple)
. Before starting the configuration, open the *Output* panel to the *Mule DX Server* to track the progress of internal processing.
+
To open the panel:

.. Press Cmd+Shift+u (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) to open the Output panel.
.. Select *Mule DX Server* from the drop-down menu in the panel.
+
For more guidance, see xref:start-open-output-panel.adoc[].
. In `american-flights-api.raml`, paste this RAML code for the `/flights` endpoint and `get` method into the file:
+
[source,raml,linenums]
--
#%RAML 1.0
title: American Flights API

/flights:
  get:
--
. On the next line directly under `get`, press Ctrl+Space to display all the available options, and select a `post` method:
+
[source,RAML]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: American Flights API

/flights:
  get:
  post:
----
. Click the API Console icon to display your specification in the console:
+
image::acb-api-console.png["A specification with get and post methods"]
+
.. Monitor *Mule DX Server* in the *Output* panel while the API Console loads.
.. Click your specification file in the editor to display endpoints for the specification file in API Console.
.. Wait for the endpoint icons to render in API Console.
+
Endpoint and methods in the API Console:
+
//NOTE internal: image modified to have heading "Documentation"
image::get-post-methods-api-console.png["GET and POST methods highlighted in *API Console*"]
. Proceed to <<add-query-params-nested-resources>>.

[[add-query-params-nested-resources]]
== Add Query Parameters and Nested Resources

Add a nested resource (`/{ID}:`) to use for getting a flight based on its destination, and specify optional query parameters for the destinations (`queryParameters:`) as a set of `enum` values. 

. Replace your RAML content with this specification:
+
[source,raml,linenums]
--
#%RAML 1.0
title: American Flights API

/flights:
  get:
    queryParameters:
      destination:
        required: false
        enum:
          - SFO
          - LAX
          - CLE
  post:

  /{ID}:
    get:
--
. View the nested resource in the API Console:
+
image::sub-methods-api-console.png["API Console with nested resource"]
. Proceed to xref:tut-af-design-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[].
