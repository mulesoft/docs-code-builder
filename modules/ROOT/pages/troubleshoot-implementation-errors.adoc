If you attempt to scaffold an API spec that includes this type of dependency by 
xref:imp-implement-apis.adoc#import-spec-into-project[importing it from Exchange into an integration project] (using `MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange`), you see a message like the following:

*Something failed during scaffolding API, please check logs for more details*

The scaffold fails and the flows and other elements aren't created.

If you attempt to scaffold an API spec that includes this type of dependency into a new implementation project (using xref:imp-implement-local-apis.adoc#scaffold-spec-into-project[multi-root workspaces]),
the implementation project folder structure is not created and the error message is:

*Something failed while scaffolding API*
