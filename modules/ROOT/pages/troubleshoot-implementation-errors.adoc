== Something Failed While Scaffolding an API

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="fragments-not-scaffolded"]

If you attempt to scaffold an API that references these types of fragments, you see a message like the following:

*Something failed while scaffolding API*

The scaffold fails and the flows and other elements aren't created.

If you use the iterative approach to scaffold the API (using xref:imp-implement-local-apis.adoc#scaffold-spec-into-project[multi-root workspaces]),
the implementation project folder structure is not created.

To work around this issue, before scaffolding the API:

. Add the fragment directly to a folder in your API spec project, such as `fragments`:
+
image::troubleshoot-imp-scaff.png["Fragment folder in the Explorer view"]
. Change the path to the fragment from Exchange to the local folder, for example:
+
[tabs]
====
Reference Local OAS Fragment::
+
[source,YAML,linenums]
--
$ref: fragments/frag-defs.yaml#/components/examples/flightsList
--

Reference OAS Fragment on Exchange::
+
[source,YAML,linenums]
--
$ref: exchange_modules/e91cab06-650b-4634-9c6f-5bc4f4fc4d17/frag-defs/1.0.0/frag-defs.yaml#/components/examples/flightsList
--
====
. Re-scaffold the API.
