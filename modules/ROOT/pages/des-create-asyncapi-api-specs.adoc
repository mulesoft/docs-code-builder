= Creating and Importing AsyncAPI Specifications
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

Use Anypoint Code Builder to design, import, govern, and test AsyncAPI specs before publishing to Anypoint Exchange:

. Create and design an AsyncAPI spec project in Anypoint Code Builder from the IDE or by importing the spec from Design Center:

* <<design-new-api-spec, Create and design an AsyncAPI spec project from the IDE>>
* <<import-spec, Import an AsyncAPI spec from Design Center>>

. <<open-output-panel, Track progress in the output panel>>.
. <<review-spec-console, Review your spec in the API console>>.

Use the <<example-asyncapi-api-spec,`asyncapi-example`>> API spec to explore the functionality of Anypoint Code Builder.

== Before You Begin

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* Understand the basics of designing AsyncAPI specs.
* Have some familiarity with xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[business groups].
+
When you publish your API spec to Exchange from Anypoint Code Builder, the IDE requests the name of the business group. See xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[].

[[design-new-api-spec]]
== Create and Design a New AsyncAPI Specification Project

To create and design an AsyncAPI spec project in Anypoint Code Builder:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["Anypoint Code Builder icon highlighted in the activity bar"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Design an API*:
+
image::design-api-1.png["*Design an API* link highlighted in the *Quick Actions* section"]

. Complete the *API Specification* form:
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"]
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the AsyncAPI spec title in Exchange, the name of the spec file, and the name of the project's root directory.
For example, if the project name is _AsyncAPI Example_, the spec file name is `asyncapi-example`.

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="no-project-name-reuse"]
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create.

See xref:start-add-folders.adoc[].

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="proj-directory-warn"]
| *API Type* | The type of API spec to create.

Available options are *REST API* and *AsyncAPI*.

Select *AsyncAPI* to use the <<example-asyncapi-api-spec,example>> in this procedure.

| *API Specification Language* | See xref:des-designing-api-specs.adoc#supported-spec-languages[Supported AsyncAPI Versions].

Select *AsyncAPI 2.6 (YAML)* to use the <<example-asyncapi-api-spec,example>> in this procedure.
|===
. Click *Create Project*.
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the folder.
+
When the project is ready for editing, the API project opens the spec in the Editor view, for example, this AsyncAPI 2.6 (YAML) spec:
+
image::des-asyncapi-create.png[New AsyncAPI 2.6 (YAML) API project]
. Continue designing your API spec.
+
As you enter elements, use xref:start-discover-ui.adoc#auto-complete[auto-complete] (Ctrl+Space) to display available options within the context.

[[import-spec]]
== Import an AsyncAPI Specification from Design Center

Import an AsyncAPI spec from Design Center, and optionally, keep your project in sync with Design Center by using the Anypoint source control management (SCM) system. Alternatively, use Git or another SCM that is compatible with VS Code in the desktop or cloud IDE. For more information, see xref:des-designing-api-specs.adoc#anypoint-scm[Source Control for API Design Projects].

// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import API Specification from Design Center
----
. If prompted, log in to Anypoint Platform through the IDE.
. Complete the import process:
.. Select your business group from the *Select a Business Group* popup.
.. Search for the API spec in the *APIs from Design Center* field.
.. Navigate to or create a folder for the spec, and click *Select target folder*.
+
If you receive an error that the import failed (*Importing project _a_project_name_ has failed*), check your target folder for a project with the same name. To address a duplicate naming issue before importing, you can import the design project to a different target folder or delete the project from your IDE (see xref:des-delete-api-projects.adoc[]).
. Edit or continue designing your spec, as needed.
+
As you enter elements, use xref:start-discover-ui.adoc#auto-complete[auto-complete] (Ctrl+Space) to display available options within the context.
. Optionally, sync your changes with Design Center by using the Anypoint SCM.
+
This feature is available only for API projects that you import from Design Center. You can also store your work in another SCM. For SCM options, see xref:start-scm.adoc[].

[[open-output-panel]]
== Track Progress in the Output Panel

To track the progress of internal processing as you design your API:

// Pointer to Output Panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-output-panel"]
. Select *Mule DX Server* from the dropdown:
+
image::des-output-panel.png["Mule DX Server in the output pane"]

[[review-spec-console]]
== Review Your Spec in the API Console

To display your spec in the console:

. Click your spec file in the editor.
. Click the image:icon-api-console.png["",14,14] (*API Console*) icon.
+
Alternatively, you can provide the command `MuleSoft: API Console` from the xref:start-use-command-palette.adoc[Command Palette].
. Wait for the channels to render in the API Console.
+
The API Console show the channels for the spec, for example:
+
image::des-asyncapi-api-console.png["AsyncAPI spec in the API Console"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. Click a channel to view details.
.. Display the console menu.
. Click channels in the console or select items from the menu to view different parts of your spec.
For example, click *PUBLISH*:
+
image::des-asyncapi-api-console-detail.png["API Console with Publish details"]

[[example-asyncapi-api-spec]]
== Example AsyncAPI (YAML) API Specification

If you created an AsyncAPI 2.6 (YAML) project, you can replace the initial spec with this example code:
