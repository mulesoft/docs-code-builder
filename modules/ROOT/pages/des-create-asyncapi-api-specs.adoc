= Creating and Importing AsyncAPI API Specifications
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

Use Anypoint Code Builder to create, import, and test AsyncAPI API specs before publishing to Anypoint Exchange:

. Create an AsyncAPI API spec project in Anypoint Code Builder from the IDE or by importing the spec from Design Center:

* <<design-new-api-spec, Create an AsyncAPI API spec project from the IDE>>
* <<import-spec, Import an AsyncAPI API spec from Design Center>>

. <<open-output-panel, Track progress in the output panel>>.
. <<review-spec-console, Review your spec in the API console>>.
. <<test-spec, Test your spec using the mocking service>>.

Use the <<example-asyncapi-api-spec,`asyncapi-example`>> API spec to explore the functionality of Anypoint Code Builder.

== Before You Begin

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* Understand the basics of designing AsyncAPI API specs.
* Have some familiarity with xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[business groups].
+
When you publish your API spec to Exchange from Anypoint Code Builder, the IDE requests the name of the business group. See xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[].

== Create a New AsyncAPI API Specification Project

To create an AsyncAPI API spec project in Anypoint Code Builder:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["Anypoint Code Builder icon highlighted in the activity bar"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Design an API*:
+
image::design-api-1.png["*Design an API* link highlighted in the *Quick Actions* section"]

. Complete the *API Specification* form:
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"]
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the AsyncAPI API spec title in Exchange, the name of the spec file, and the name of the project's root directory.
For example, if the project name is _AsyncAPI Example_, the spec file name is `asyncapi-example`.

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="no-project-name-reuse"]
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create.

See xref:start-add-folders.adoc[].

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="proj-directory-warn"]
| *API Type* | The type of API spec to create.

Available options are *REST API* and *AsyncAPI*.

Select *AsyncAPI* to use the <<example-asyncapi-api-spec,example>> in this procedure.

| *API Specification Language* | See xref:des-designing-api-specs.adoc#supported-spec-languages[Supported AsyncAPI Versions].

Select *AsyncAPI 2.6 (YAML)* to use the <<example-asyncapi-api-spec,example>> in this procedure.
|===
. Click *Create Project*.
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the folder.
+
When the project is ready for editing, the API project opens the spec in the Editor view, for example, this AsyncAPI 2.6 (YAML) spec:
+
image::des-asyncapi-create.png[New OAS 3.0 (YAML) API project]
. Continue designing your API spec.
+
As you enter elements, use xref:start-discover-ui.adoc#auto-complete[auto-complete] (Ctrl+Space) to display available options within the context.
