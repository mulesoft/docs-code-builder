= Tracking Requests with Autodiscovery

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 


Set up API autodiscovery in a Mule app to display key metrics in API Manager, including requests to endpoints in the app. API Manager is part of Anypoint Platform. 

image:anypoint-code-builder::autodiscovery-data-apim.png["View request metrics for a Mule app in API Manager"]

Autodiscovery configuration in a Mule app requires an API instance ID from an API in API Manager that runs on a Mule Gateway runtime, and your app requires Anypoint Platform credentials (client ID and secret) for connecting to your API in API Manager.

[[prereqs]]
== Before You Begin

To obtain the API instance ID for your Mule app's autodiscovery configuration, you must have access to an API in API Manager that runs on a Mule Gateway runtime, or you can create your API by following the procedure in xref:api-manager::create-instance-task-mule.adoc[], in the API Manager documentation.

APIs in API Manager are associated with an API spec on Anypoint Exchange that defines endpoints in your Mule app. For an API spec example that defines an endpoint and a Mule app example that implements the endpoint, see <<examples>>. 

For guidance creating API specs, see:

** xref:anypoint-code-builder::des-create-api-specs.adoc[] to design a spec from Anypoint Code Builder
** xref:design-center::design-designing-api-specs-fragments.adoc[] to design a spec from Design Center 

* For guidance publishing an API specs to Exchange, see:

** xref:anypoint-code-builder::des-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[] to publish your spec from Anypoint Code Builder 
** xref:design-center::design-publish.adoc[] to publish your spec from Design Center

[[setup]]
== Set Up API Autodiscovery in a Mule App

Configure a Mule app to send request data to an API running on a Mule Gateway runtime in API Manager. The API tracks this data in charts on API Manager. 

Autodiscovery configuration of a Mule app requires a global element (`<api-gateway:discovery/>`) that references an API instance ID along with credentials (client ID and secret) that enable the Mule runtime engine in your Mule app to connect to the Anypoint Platform business group or environment for your API in API Manager. 

To set up autodiscovery:

. Meet the prerequisites in <<prereqs>>.
. Obtain the client ID and secret for your business group from Access Management (https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/businessGroups/[US], https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/businessGroups[EU]), in Anypoint Platform.
+

[loweralpha]
. Open the list of business groups in Access Management, on Anypoint Platform (https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/businessGroups/[US], https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/businessGroups[EU]).
+
To navigate to the business group list from the Anypoint Platform home page instead, open Access Management, and click *Business Groups*.
. In the business group list, click the name of your business group.
. Click the *Settings* tab for your business group.
. Obtain the *Client ID* and *Client Secrets* values from the *Settings* tab in Access Manager.

. Obtain the API instance ID from your API instance in API Manager.

====
[loweralpha]
. In Anypoint Platform (https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/businessGroups/[US], https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/businessGroups[EU]), navigate to API Manager.
. In the *API Administration* page of API Manager, locate and click the name of your API to open its *API Summary* page.
. Find the *API Instance ID* in the *API Summary* page. 
+
You'll need the instance ID when configuring your Mule app for autodiscovery.
====
--
. In your Mule app in Anypoint Code Builder, use your API instance ID to pair your app to the API instance:
.. In the XML editor for your Mule app, add the `<api-gateway:autodiscovery/>` element, for example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<api-gateway:autodiscovery apiId="YOUR_API_ID_HERE" flowRef="currentTimeFlow" doc:name="Autodiscovery" />
----
+
For more complete context, see the example in <<mule-app>>.
.. Paste your API instance ID as the `apiID` value, for example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<api-gateway:autodiscovery apiId="123456" flowRef="currentTimeFlow" doc:name="Autodiscovery" />
----
. In Anypoint Code Builder, append the client ID and client secret for your business group to the Mule runtime arguments in the *Settings* tab:
+
.. Open the *Settings* tab. 
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="mule-settings-nav-options"]
.. In the *Settings* tab, find  *Mule â€º Runtime: Default Arguments*.
.. In the text field, append your client ID and secret arguments to the end of the existing arguments, for example:
+
----
-M-Danypoint.platform.client_id=999abcde1f888e9h9aaa00ff5a5b03c5 -M-Danypoint.platform.client_secret=abc0d1234e5a4ab321A000B2033D4E56
----
+
Replace the values in the example with your client ID and secret.

. Run your application to ensure that the API is connected by checking the build logs for the following information:

* The client ID and client secret validated successfully against API Manager. 
* The underlying `GateKeeper` is available (unblocked) and in `FLEXIBLE` mode.
* The API Gateway extension is in `STANDALONE` mode.

. Send requests to an endpoint in your app that is tracked by your API instance.
+
For guidance, see xref:int-trigger-flows.adoc[].
. In API Manager, check that the API instance is now registered (active) and produces metrics in API Manager.

[[examples]]
=== Examples

Examples tested for API autodiscovery include the following:

* <<oas-spec>>:
+
Testing involved creating the spec in Design Center, publishing the spec to Exchange, creating an Mule Gateway API instance in API Manager that is associated with the spec on Exchange.
* <<mule-app>>
+
Testing involved adding the `<api-gateway:autodiscovery/>` element with the `apiID` value from API Manager, appending the client ID and secret to the Mule runtime arguments in Anypoint Code Builder settings, running the app in debug mode to deploy the app locally, making requests to the defined endpoint in the app, and checking that the associated Mule Gateway API instance on API Manager is *Active* and that the requests produce data (key metrics) in the instance's charts.

The following OAS spec defines a single endpoint in the <<mule-app, Mule app example>>.
