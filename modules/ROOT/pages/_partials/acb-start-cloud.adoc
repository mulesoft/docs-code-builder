The cloud IDE remains in an open beta period. 

During the open beta, your cloud IDE instance might get deleted, causing you to lose your integrations, automations, and APIs.

To save your work, commit your project files to a source control management (SCM) system. See xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-scm.adoc[].

If you are using an Anypoint Platform trial account that loses access to Anypoint Code Builder after your trial expires, the cloud IDE instances are deleted.

Do not use the beta version of Anypoint Code Builder to develop APIs, integrations, or automations for production environments.

After provisioning of your cloud IDE is complete, the IDE opens. The provisioning process can take a few minutes.
+
Your cloud IDE environment is associated with your user account. The cloud environment also has a unique URL that only you can access and that is _not_ embedded within the Anypoint Platform UI. You can reopen your cloud IDE directly from that URL or relaunch it indirectly from Anypoint Code Builder in Anypoint Platform.
