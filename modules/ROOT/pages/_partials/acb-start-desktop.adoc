== Before You Begin Desktop IDE Setup

Before installing the desktop extensions to VS Code, set up git and have an Anypoint Platform account with the required permissions:

* Install https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git^], and add git to your `PATH`. To work properly, some Anypoint Extension Pack extensions depend on this requirement.

To uninstall:

. Open VS Code. 
. From the activity bar, open the Extensions panel.
. Find and select Anypoint Extension Pack.
. In the Anypoint Extension Pack tab that opens, click *Uninstall*. 
. To remove the Anypoint Code Builder extensions from the Extensions panel, click *Reload* on one of the extensions. 

For additional guidance, see the VS Code documentation, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_manage-extensions[Manage extensions^].

You can reinstall at any time.
