Group components in a scope and execute them simultaneously with the main flow in an asynchronous fashion.

//end::component-short-description[]
//

//
//tag::component-long-description[]

The main flow of the application continues to execute after it initiates and processes the Async scope. The flow does not have to pause until the last message processor embedded in the asynchronous flow has completed its task. Async is useful for executing time-consuming operations that do not require you to send a response back to the initiating flow (such as printing a file or connecting to a mail server).

To facilitate simultaneous branch processing, the Async scope sends one copy of the message it has received to the first embedded message processor in its own processing block. At the same time, it sends another copy of the message to the next message processor in the main flow.  

Because the Async scope is executed in a "fire and forget" manner, the result of the processing within the scope is not available in the main flow.

Async (`<async/>`) attributes are configurable through the UI and XML.

|===
| Attribute Name
| Attribute XML
| Description

| *Async* (default)
| `doc:name` 
| Editable name that appears in the configuration XML file only.

| *Name* or *Display Name*
| `name` 
| Editable name for the component that appears in the canvas.

| *Max concurrency*
| `maxConcurrency` 
a| Sets the maximum number of concurrent messages that the scope can process. By default, the container thread pool determines the maximum number of threads to use to optimize the performance when processing messages. When the scope is processing the maximum number of concurrent messages, it cannot receive additional requests.

Set `maxConcurrency` to `1` to cause the scope to process requests one at a time.

== Async Scopes versus Subflows

Unlike a subflow, an Async scope:

* Does not inherit the exception strategy of the main flow.
+
To handle errors in an Async scope, use the Try scope.
+
* Processes messages asynchronously.
* Does not pass data back to the main flow.
* Exists inline with the main flow thread.
* Is not called by a Flow Reference component.
* Is not reusable

Even though the Async scope receives a copy of the Mule message, the payload is not copied. The same payload objects are referenced by both Mule messages: One that continues down the original flow, and the one processed by the Async scope.

If the payload of your message is a mutable object (for example, a bean with different fields in it) and a message processor in your Async scope changes the value of one of the fields, the message processors outside of the Async scope see the changed values.

== Example Async Scope Configuration

//tag::component-xml-ex1[]
[[example1]]

The following XML fragment shows an example configuration of an Async scope inside an application flow. The Async scope contains a `file:read` operation that executes asynchronously once triggered, while the application continues processing the next operation in the flow, `http:request`.

<!-- Main application flow -->
<flow name="myMainFlow" >
  <!-- HTTP Listener as event source -->
  <http:listener doc:name="Listener" />

    <!-- The Async scope executes its message processors in a different thread, while the main flow continues its execution -->
    <async doc:name="Async" >
      <!-- A Try scope to handle errors, because the async scope does not inherit the error strategy from the flow -->
      <try doc:name="Try" >
