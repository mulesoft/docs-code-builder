Group together a sequence of Core components and operations (provided by connectors and modules) inside a scope that you invoke from a Flow Reference in your Mule application.

//tag::component-long-description[]

The Subflow component works in a similar way to the xref:acb-component-flow.adoc[Flow] component but with the following differences: 

* Subflows do not support Mule event sources.
* Subflows do not have a built-in error handling scope.
+ 
//TODO: Uncomment when Try doc is ready in ACB
//Use the xref:acb-component-try.adoc[Try] scope within a subflow to perform error handling.
* During design, subflows work as macros that replace the Flow Reference components that call them.
+
When you build the application, Mule replaces all Flow Reference components that call a subflow with the contents of the referenced subflow.
* Referencing subflows results in better performance than referencing a flow.

//TODO: Uncomment when Try doc is ready in ACB
//Use the xref:acb-component-try.adoc[Try] scope within a subflow to perform error handling.
You can create multiple subflows in your Mule application. 

For a more in-depth discussion of uses, capabilities, and limits of flows and subflows, see xref:4.4@mule-runtime::about-flows.adoc[Flows and Subflows].

//TODO: Uncomment when Async doc is ready in ACB
//Flows always function synchronously. To achieve asynchronous patterns, such as Fire-and-Forget, use the xref:acb-component-async.adoc[Async Scope].

== Limitations

Because the contents of a subflow replace each Flow Reference component that references that subflow, several instances of the event processors inside that subflow exist in the application at runtime. This behavior can cause issues with event processors that depend on unique IDs or instances to execute.
//TODO: Uncomment when Batch docs are ready.
//For example, configuring a batch job inside a subflow causes the application to fail during deployment if the subflow is referenced from more than one Flow Reference component. The application fails to deploy because multiple instances of a batch job with the same job instance ID exist, which is not allowed.

== Component XML

This component supports the following XML structure:

//end::component-xml-title[]

//tag::component-xml[]

[source,xml]

<sub-flow name="mySubFlow">

</sub-flow>

=== Snippet JSON

Snippet JSON in Anypoint Code Builder serves as a customizable template for the component.

//TABLE: ROOT XML ATTRIBUTES (for the top-level (root) element)

Subflow (`<sub-flow/>`) attributes are configurable through the UI and XML.

[%header,cols="1,1,3a"]

| Attribute Name
| Attribute XML 
| Description

| *name1* (default)
| `name`

The following example uses a Scheduler as a source to trigger the execution of a flow every 10 seconds and then connects to a subflow (`<sub-flow/>`) through a Flow Ref (`<flow-ref/>`) component. The subflow then connects to another subflow, also using a Flow Ref component.
