= Deleting API Specs and Fragments
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

To delete a design project for your API spec or fragment from Anypoint Code Builder, delete the entire project folder. If you imported the API spec from Design Center or if your project was created with earlier versions of Anypoint Code Builder (prior to February 2024) that required storage of the spec in the Anypoint SCM, you can also delete the project from Design Center. Deletion is necessary if you want to reuse the project name for a new design project in Anypoint Code Builder. 

== Before You Begin

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* Create a xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[spec] or xref:des-create-api-fragments.adoc[fragment].

// note on limited scope of this section:

Design project names must be unique. If your design project is stored in the Anypoint SCM, it also exists in Design Center. To create a new design project with the same name in Anypoint Code Builder, you must delete the existing project not only from Anypoint Code Builder but also from Design Center. If you want the project to remain in the Anypoint SCM, do not delete it from Design Center.

To delete an API project (API spec or API spec fragment) from Design Center:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, <<delete-spec, delete the spec>>.
. Navigate to Anypoint Platform and log in using your credentials.
