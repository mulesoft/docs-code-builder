= Deleting API Specs and Fragments
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

To delete a design project for your API spec or fragment from Anypoint Code Builder, delete the entire project folder. If you imported the API spec from Design Center or if your project was created with earlier versions of Anypoint Code Builder (prior to February 2024) that required storage of the spec in the Anypoint SCM, you can also delete the project from Design Center. Deletion is necessary if you want to reuse the project name for a new design project in Anypoint Code Builder.
