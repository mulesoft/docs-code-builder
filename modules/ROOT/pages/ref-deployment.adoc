= Deployment Settings in Anypoint Code Builder
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide


When deploying a Mule application to CloudHub, Anypoint Code Builder relies on a configuration in `deploy.json`. Mule applications are integration or implementation projects.

`deploy.json` example:

----
{
  "runtime": "4.7-e-java17",
  "workerSize": 0.1,
  "applicationName": "my-integration-app",
  "workers": 1,
  "autoStart": true
}
----

* `runtime`: Provides the Mule runtime version used by the project. 
* `workersize`: 
* `applicationName`: Name of the Mule application.
* `workers`: 
* `autoStart`:
