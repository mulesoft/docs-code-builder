Use Anypoint Code Builder to create and implement an API specification that returns flight information from a MySQL database: 

. xref:tut-af-design-am-flights-api.adoc[]:

* Start the American Flights API specification. 
* Add a resource and methods.
* Add query parameters and nested resources.
* Add fragments and examples:
** Add API fragments from Exchange for a data type and examples to the American Flights API specification. 
** Create your own examples for the specification.
** Add a custom message for a response.
. xref:tut-af-design-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[] 
+
Use the Mocking Service in the API Console to check the request and responses that you configured for American Flights API.
. xref:tut-af-design-api-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[]:
+
Publish the American Flights API specification to Exchange so that other team members can find and implement it.
//develop example:
. Create an integration application for the American Flights example: 

.. xref:tut-af-integrate-am-flights.adoc[]:
+
Start by creating a basic integration for the American Flights example. This integration provides some of the logic for processing requests from the American Flights API. 
.. xref:tut-af-integrate-connect-to-a-db.adoc[]:

* Import the Anypoint Connector for Database (Database Connector) from Exchange. 
* Configure a database operation to connect to an external database from your Mule flow.
.. xref:tut-af-integrate-use-dataweave.adoc[]:
+
Use DataWeave to transform and match flight data to your API specification.
//implement example:
. xref:tut-af-implement-am-flights-api.adoc[]:

* Import your American Flights API specification from Anypoint Exchange. 
* Scaffold the specification into the American Flights project that you are developing.
* Add logic to implement an endpoint in the API.
//debug example:
. xref:tut-af-debug-am-flights.adoc[]:

* Prepare to debug your Mule application by adding Logger and Set Variable components to better understand the behavior of your flows.
* Set up breakpoints to stop your Mule application at specific points during a debug session.
* Run a debug session, and inspect the message and variables at different points during your application's execution.
//deploy example:
. xref:tut-af-deploy-am-flights.adoc[]: 

* Deploy your American Flights application to CloudHub. 
* Enable your team to send requests to your API and return flight information from a database.
