Deploy the American Flights application to CloudHub. After deploying to CloudHub, manage your application through Anypoint Runtime Manager.

Anypoint Code Builder deploys Mule applications to the non-production *Sandbox* environment in CloudHub.

== Before You Begin

Complete these procedures: 

. xref:tut-af-design-am-flights-api.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-integrate-am-flights.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-implement-am-flights-api.adoc[]
. xref:tut-af-debug-am-flights.adoc[]
. Log in to Anypoint Platform from the IDE. If you do not log in, the IDE prompts you to log in when an operation that you perform requires authentication. You can follow the prompts in the UI to complete the login process when prompted.


== Deploy an Application to CloudHub

. Open your project in Anypoint Code Builder.
. Click the *Deploy to CloudHub* (rocket) icon when your configuration XML file is open, for example:
+
image::deploy-to-cloudhub-icon-with-detail.png["Deploy to CloudHub "rocket" icon]
+
Alternatively, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Deploy to CloudHub
----
+
image::deploy-to-cloudhub.png["MuleSoft: Deploy to CloudHub command highlighted"]
. If prompted, sign in to Anypoint Platform.
. When prompted, click *Deploy*.
+
Anypoint Code Builder creates and opens a deployment file (`deploy.json`) for your review, for example:
+
[source,json]
--
{
  "runtime": "4.4.0",
  "workerSize": 0.1,
  "applicationName": "american-ws-anypoint-code-builder"
  "workers": 1,
  "autoStart": true
}
--
+
The `applicationName` property defines part of the URL for accessing your application on CloudHub. 
+
//TODO: VERIFY
The name must be unique across all applications deployed to your business group in CloudHub.
. After reviewing the deployment configuration, select *Deploy* to deploy the application to CloudHub.
+
image::deploy-config-created.png["Deployment configuration file created pop-up message"]
. Select the *Sandbox* environment:
+
image::select-deployment-environment.png["Design and Sandbox environment options highlighted"]
+
Other environments are not supported. 
+
Anypoint Code Builder packages and deploys the application to CloudHub.
. After deployment completes, select *Open in Runtime Manager*.
. Select your application from the list applications. 
. Check the domain name for your application and, optionally, test the application. 
+
For example, the name of the American Flights example on the EU cloud is similar to `+american-ws-anypoint-code-builder.eu-s1.cloudhub.io+`. To start the example, open your REST client or browser, and make a GET request to the URI, for example: `+http://american-ws-anypoint-code-builder.eu-s1.cloudhub.io/api/flights+`
