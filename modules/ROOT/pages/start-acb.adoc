Anypoint Code Builder is built from the Anypoint Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code. Both the desktop and cloud IDEs for Anypoint Code Builder share these extensions. The cloud IDE provides built-in extensions to the code-server implementation of Visual Studio Code for the web.

* <<set-up-desktop>>: For the desktop IDE, you must load the extension pack to your local Visual Studio Code IDE. 
* <<set-up-web>>: For the cloud IDE, you must log in to Anypoint Platform and acquire the permission to use Anypoint Code Builder. 

[[set-up-desktop]]
== Set up the Desktop IDE

//start desktop IDE
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-start-desktop.adoc[]

[[set-up-web]]
== Launch the Cloud IDE 

//launch cloud IDE
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-start-cloud.adoc[]

[[login-ide]]
== Log in to Anypoint Platform from the IDE

Some Anypoint Code Builder features require you to log in directly from the IDE to Anypoint Platform. The IDE prompts you when login is necessary and guides you through the login process. However, it is a good practice to log in from the IDE after opening MuleSoft features in the IDE. 

//Requirements for Anypoint Platform account and account config
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="platform-account"]

From the IDE, you can log in from the status bar or through a command:

* <<login-status-bar>>
* <<login-command>>
* <<change-user-account>>

[[login-status-bar]]
=== Log in from the IDE through the Status Bar

The status bar in the desktop and cloud IDEs shows your login status:

* *Not logged in to Anypoint Platform* indicates that you must log in to perform tasks that require a connection to Anypoint Platform. 
+
image::acb-not-logged-in.png["Login status message in the status bar"]
+ 
You can log in by clicking this notification and following the prompts to log in.
* A link to your user name indicates that you are logged in.
+
You can log out by clicking your user name and following the prompts.

[[login-command]]
=== Log in from the IDE through the Command Palette

You can use the Command Palette to log in to Anypoint Platform. 

To log in from the IDE from the Command Palette:

// Pointer to Command Palette
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Login to Anypoint Platform
----
+
image::anypoint-code-builder::login-to-anypoint-platform.png["Login command within the Command Palette"]
+
[TIP]
--
You can type `login` and use the filter in the results to select the command you want.
--
. Select *Allow* when prompted to sign in to the platform.
+
image::anypoint-code-builder::allow-login-to-anypoint-platform.png[]
+
After logging you in, Anypoint Platform displays a *You can close this page now* message.
+
. To verify your login, ensure that *<your-username>* replaces *Not logged in to Anypoint Platform*. 

[[change-user-account]]
=== Log In with a Different Anypoint Platform Account from the IDE

To use a different Anypoint Platform user account:

. Log out of the IDE by:

.. Clicking your username in the status bar 
.. Clicking *Yes* when asked *Logout from Anypoint?* 
. Log in from the status bar. 
+
For more guidance, see <<login-status-bar>>.

[[change-clouds]]
== Set the Desktop IDE to the EU or US Cloud

In the desktop IDE, you can change your Anypoint Platform control plane to the US or EU cloud. US cloud is the default. Anypoint Platform instances do not share user accounts, projects, or other data. For more information, see xref:index.adoc#us-eu-clouds[US and EU Cloud Hosts]. engineering
