= Version Settings for Mule, Java, and Connectors
//used in procedures:
:open-project: Open your implementation or integration project. 

Set Mule runtime engine (Mule), Java, and connector versions to use in your projects.

* <<default-versions, Default versions>>: Set default Mule and Java versions to display in version drop-down menus. 

* Project-level versions: Set versions to use in a specific project.
** For Mule and Java versions, see <<project-version-mule-java>>.
** For connector versions, see <<project-versions-connectors>>.  

[[default-versions]]
== Select Default Mule and Java Versions

Select the default Mule and Java versions for new implementation and integration projects. The defaults appear in drop-down menus from which you select a version, for example, when creating a project. 

Versions that are not present in the IDE append a message similar to *downloads upon project creation*. Versions that do not support a feature typically append a message, such as *AsyncAPI implementation unsupported* for Mule 4.4. 

You can set a different version at the project level (see <<project-version-mule-java>>).

=== Select Defaults from the Command Palette

To select the default Mule and Java versions from the command palette:

//step: open command palette:

[[project-version-mule-java]]
== Select Mule and Java Versions for a Project

Set Mule or Java versions for a specific implementation or integration project from *Project Properties*. You can change versions at any time, but it is important to test your projects with the versions you intend to deploy. 

Version settings are important in several scenarios:

* Updating a project to use more current versions
* Switching to a supported version, for example, for a project that you import into Anypoint Code Builder that uses an unsupported version
* Adding a version of Mule or Java that is missing from your project
* Selecting versions of Mule or Java that are compatible with each other

When a Mule or Java version is unset for a project, the IDE's canvas and notifications provide a *Set version* button that opens the *Project Properties* tab. You can also navigate directly to the *Project Properties* tab. 


[[project-versions-from-properties]]
To select Mule and Java versions for a project:

//open project local attribute:
. {open-project}
//step: open project properties tab from Project Properties menu item
include::partial$acb-runtime-java.adoc[tags="open-project-properties-properties"]
//step: open project properties tab
include::partial$acb-runtime-java.adoc[tags="open-project-properties-menu"]
. In *Project Properties*, select the versions to use in this project.
