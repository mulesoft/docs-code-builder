You can use Anypoint Code Builder to deploy your Mule application to CloudHub.

NOTE: Anypoint Code Builder can deploy applications only to the 1.0 version of CloudHub. To deploy to CloudHub 2.0, create a deployable JAR file, and follow a deployment procedure identified in xref:int-export-mule-project.adoc#deployable[Export to a Deployable JAR File].

== Before You Begin

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[Create an integration].
* Install a REST client, such as Postman or AdvancedRestClient.

== Deploy an App to CloudHub

When you deploy an application to CloudHub, Anypoint Code Builder configures a default `deploy.json` file in your `src/main/resources` directory.
If you intend to configure properties at deployment time, for example, 
to xref:int-create-secure-configs.adoc[create secure properties], Anypoint Code Builder prompts you to modify `deploy.json` during deployment the deployment process.

To deploy your app to CloudHub:

// Open IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
. Open the configuration XML file for the Mule app to deploy.
. Click the image:icon-deploy.png["",20,20] (*Deploy to CloudHub*) icon.
+
Alternatively, open the Command Palette and select `MuleSoft: Deploy to CloudHub`.
// +
// Pointer to Command Palette
// include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. If prompted, click *Allow* to allow sign in using Anypoint Platform and select the business group.
+
If the project doesn't already have a `deploy.json` file, Anypoint Code Builder prompts that a deployment configuration file has been created and opens it for you to review, for example:
+
image::int-deploy-json-desktop.png["Review deploy.json file"]
+
The `applicationName` property defines part of the URL that you use to access your application on CloudHub.
+
This name must be unique across all applications deployed to CloudHub.
. After reviewing the deployment configuration, click *Deploy* to deploy the application to CloudHub.
. At the prompt, select the environment to deploy to.
+
Anypoint Code Builder packages the application and deploys it to CloudHub.
The Output panel opens with *Mule Maven Output* selected:
+
image::int-deploy-output.png["Output panel with Mule Maven Output selected"]
. After deployment completes, click *Open in Runtime Manager*.
+
Your app opens in Runtime Manager in Anypoint Platform.
+
The domain name of the application varies, but it follows a similar structure such as: `app-with-40-schedulers.us-w1.cloudhub.io`.
. Open your preferred REST client and make a GET request to the domain name as 
displayed in Runtime Manager, for example, `+http://app-with-100-schedulers.us-w1.cloudhub.io/api/flights+`.
