After you create your API spec, use Anypoint Code Builder to scaffold your API 
into a Mule project for your implementation or integration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="fragments-not-scaffolded"]
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="fragments-inline"]
====

Anypoint Code Builder uses the configuration defined in the spec to 
autogenerate a basic interface in your implementation project.
This interface includes flows for each endpoint or operation, a built-in XML-based router, and error handlers,
which you then implement within a Mule application.

The process you use to implement your API depends on whether you already
created a project for your integration or implementation, or published the spec to Exchange:

* To scaffold an API using a spec from Exchange into:

** A new project, see <<scaffold-new-integration>>.
** An existing project, see <<import-spec-into-project>>.

* To update your project with the latest changes to a spec in Exchange, see <<re-scaffold-spec>>.

* To scaffold and re-scaffold an API into a project without publishing 
the spec to Exchange, see xref:imp-implement-local-apis.adoc[].

[[scaffold-new-integration]]
== Scaffold an API into a New Project

If you have not already created a project, use Anypoint Code Builder to scaffold the API in a new Mule project:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["Anypoint Code Builder icon highlighted in the activity bar"]
//configure implementation creation form:
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="start-implementation"]
+
image::imp-api-search.png["Search an API from Exchange"]
+
The form shows the selected API spec, for example:
+
image:imp-api-selected.png["OAS Example API selected in the Implement an API Specification form"]
. Click *Create Project*.
+
When you create the project, Anypoint Code Builder:
+
** Adds the API spec as a dependency in your project's `pom.xml` file:
+
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="pom-api-dependency-ex"]
** Adds the Mule and Java versions to the project's `mule-artifact.json` file.
** Scaffolds your API into the new Mule project and opens the configuration XML file.
+
The configuration XML file includes the interface for your implementation project,
with flows for each endpoint in the spec, error handlers, and a built-in router, for example:
+
image:imp-api-scaffolded.png["OAS Example Integration in Anypoint Code Builder"]
This example includes:
+
--
* The main flow
* An HTTP Listener with a built-in router
* Several error handlers
--
+
For GraphQL APIs, Anypoint Code Builder also creates a data fetcher (`<graphql-router:data-fetcher>`) as a source for each Mule flow.
See the xref:tut-graphql-implement-api.adoc[] tutorial for an example GraphQL API and xref:apikit::apikit-graphql-api-mapping.adoc[] for more information about data fetchers.

You can now implement the interface within the Mule app.



[[import-spec-into-project]]
== Import an API Spec into a Project

If you have xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[created an integration project], you can scaffold an interface into the project by importing an API spec from Exchange. In this case, Anypoint Code Builder creates a separate configuration XML file for the interface in your integration project.

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your integration project in the Explorer view, for example, `my-project-name`.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
// Pointer to Import Asset from Exchange command
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="import-api-exchange"]
+
image::imp-assets-from-exchange.png["Assets from Exchange dropdown"]
. Select the API spec to import.
. At the prompt, select the version of the API spec, such as `v1.0.1`.
. When prompted to scaffold the API dependency, select *Yes*.
+
When you scaffold the API dependency, Anypoint Code Builder:
+
** Adds the API spec as a dependency in your project's `pom.xml` file:
+
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="pom-api-dependency-ex"]
** Adds the Mule and Java versions to the `mule-artifact.json` file:
+
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="mule-artifact-json-ex"]
** Adds a new configuration XML file, such as `oas-example.xml`, to the project:
+
image::imp-new-config-file.png["New configuration file in the Explorer view"]
+
The new configuration XML file includes the interface for your integration project,
with flows for each endpoint in the spec, error handlers, and a built-in router, for example:
+
image:imp-api-imported.png["OAS Example Integration in Anypoint Code Builder"]
+
This example includes:

* The main flow
* An HTTP Listener with a built-in router
* Several error handlers
+
For GraphQL APIs, Anypoint Code Builder also creates a data fetcher (`<graphql-router:data-fetcher>`) as a source for each Mule flow.
See the xref:tut-graphql-implement-api.adoc[] tutorial for an example GraphQL API and xref:apikit::apikit-graphql-api-mapping.adoc[] for more information about data fetchers.

You can now implement the interface within the Mule app.

[[re-scaffold-spec]]
== Re-scaffold an API Specification into a Project 

Re-scaffolding enables you to update a project in the IDE with the latest changes and version of an API spec in Anypoint Exchange. Re-scaffolding updates the configuration XML and `pom.xml` in your project. To re-scaffold a spec defined in a local API design project that is not published to Exchange, see xref:imp-implement-local-apis.adoc[], instead.

This procedure assumes that an updated version of the spec is available from Exchange, for example, a 2.0.0 version:

image::imp-assets-from-exchange-multiversion.png["Selecting a new version of an API spec from Exchange"]

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your implementation project in the Explorer view, for example, `my-implementation-project`.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
// Pointer to Import Asset from Exchange command
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="import-api-exchange"]
+
image::imp-assets-from-exchange-multiversion.png["Assets from Exchange dropdown"]
. At the prompt, select the version of the API spec, such as `v2.0.0`.
. When prompted to scaffold the API dependency, select *Yes*.
+
When you scaffold the API dependency, Anypoint Code Builder:

** Adds the API spec as a dependency in your project's `pom.xml` file:
+
[source,XML]
--
<dependency>
    <groupId>e91cab06-650b-4634-9c6f-5bc4f4fc4d17</groupId>
    <artifactId>phoneSync1005</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
    <classifier>oas</classifier>
    <type>zip</type>
</dependency>
--
** Updates the configuration XML file that contains the interface for your project with the changes to the imported spec.
. Check for the changes to your implementation project.
+
For example, if the updated spec adds a new endpoint, the configuration XML for the implementation project has a new flow for the endpoint. 
. If the spec introduced a new version number, open the `pom.xml`, and search for the new version of the dependency for the `artifactID` of the re-scaffolded spec.

== Tour the Interface File

After you scaffold your API spec into an interface, examine the scaffolded flows and error handlers for your interface in the UI canvas and configuration XML.

image::imp-scaffolded-flow-canvas.png["Scaffolded flows in the Canvas"]

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your interface.
. Click the image:icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the canvas UI if it doesn't open automatically.
. Click *Flow List* to navigate through flows:
+
image::int-flow-list.png["Flow List example"]

. In the configuration XML, locate the flows created for the endpoints in your API spec.

[[rename]]
== Name Your Interface and Implementation Files

When you import an API spec into an existing integration, Anypoint Code Builder
automatically names the configuration XML file based on the API spec name. 
You can change the file names to something more descriptive, such as based on their function, for example:

* `interface.xml` receives all incoming requests to your application and scaffolded flows validate and route requests.
* `implementation.xml` provides the backend logic for calls to the interface.

To rename a file, right-click on the file, select *Rename*, and provide a new name.

////
[[endpoint]]
== Configure an Endpoint through the Interface 

To receive HTTP requests through the interface, remove the HTTP listener from your implementation file
and add a Flow Ref component (`<flow-ref/>`) to a flow in your interface file.

. Open `implementation.xml`.
+ 
image::get-flights-select-listener.png["HTTP listener highlighted in the implementation.xml file"]
. Delete the *HTTP /flights* listener XML from the configuration XML:
+
[source,xml]
--
<http:listener path="flights" config-ref="inbound-request" doc:name="HTTP /flights" />
--
+
.Click for the resulting flow.
