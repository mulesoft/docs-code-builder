include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

When Anypoint Code Builder cannot process a value, the IDE provides a visual indicator to identify an issue with the value. Issues include:

* <<sample-input, Unable to find sample input>>
* <<resolve-reference, Unable to resolve reference>>
* <<expects-y, Expects _x_ but got _y_>>
* <<invalid-input, Invalid input>>

[[sample-input]]
== Unable to Find Sample Input

The DataWeave error `Unable to find sample input` applies to a Mule event variable, such as `payload`. In this case, the IDE places a wavy blue line under the value in the configuration XML file.

If your application isn't running, the IDE can't provide any information about Mule variables unless you provide sample data. 
Use xref:int-configure-dw-expressions.adoc#sample-data[Quick Fix] to provide sample data in the format and data structure that you expect to be present when the application runs.

For more information about Mule event variables, see xref:dataweave::dataweave-variables-context.adoc[].

[[resolve-reference]]
== Unable to Resolve Reference

The error `Unable to resolve reference` is typically for a sequence of characters like `afkdldjf` that is not recognized.

Either provide the intended value or use xref:int-configure-dw-expressions.adoc#sample-data[Quick Fix] to convert the character sequence into a DataWeave variable. For more information, see xref:dataweave::dataweave-variables.adoc[].

[[expects-y]]
== Expects _x_ but Got _y_

The error similar to `Expects _x_ but got _y_` typically indicates that something is wrong with the provided function. For example, `Expects 1 argument but got 0` occurs for `round()` because the function is missing an argument, in this case, a number to round. An example of a fix is `round(1.65)`. Similar errors indicate that an argument is of the wrong data type or that a function is otherwise malformed and requires correction.

Read the error message to determine what part of the expression to fix, and review the function description after the error message to learn more about the function. See xref:dataweave::dw-functions.adoc#dw_modules[DataWeave Modules] to find additional DataWeave function documentation.

[[invalid-input]]
== Invalid Input

The error `Invalid input` typically occurs when special characters, such as `?`, appear in a DataWeave expression and are not escaped, for example:
